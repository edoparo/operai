# @operai/inventory-ui

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 28872b4: Every tool now shares one look for actions, text and page layout: buttons and
  dialogs come from the shared library with the same meaning-based styles
  (primary actions meet contrast everywhere, cancel is quiet, destructive is
  red), text uses one type scale with an 11px minimum, labels drop their "+"
  and arrow prefixes, each tool has the same title bar, tabs and page header on
  a common width scale, and every detail page has a "Back to …" link. EstimAI's
  shortcuts, health and About dialogs are now real modal dialogs.
- 28872b4: Tables, paging, forms and feedback now work the same in every tool: record
  lists are accessible data tables, long lists page the same way, every form
  marks required fields with an asterisk and explains errors next to the field
  (moving focus to the first one), amounts accept a comma or a dot, dates use
  the date picker, every save, invite and delete confirms where you acted,
  errors you can retry are orange and errors you must fix are red, EstimAI no
  longer uses browser alert boxes, and the page no longer scrolls behind an open
  dialog.
- 28872b4: The whole suite now speaks Italian as well as English: every tool has a
  complete Italian translation and follows the browser's language, chosen once
  for all tools. Dates read the same everywhere (31.10.2026), amounts show their
  currency code with the language's separators, statuses use one shared set of
  icons and colours so the same symbol always means the same thing, emoji and
  text symbols are replaced by real icons that render on every system, headings
  are in sentence case, loading and empty screens look the same in every tool,
  detail pages are organised in cards, and EstimAI's views are proper tabs.
- 26521e2: The supplier field now suggests the suppliers already in the register, on the
  register form and in the Edit dialog. It is still free text: a new supplier is
  typed as before. Suggestions come from a new `GET /suppliers` endpoint, limited
  to the entities the caller can read.

### Patch Changes

- 28872b4: The design system gains `Combobox` (suggestions while typing) and `Drawer` (a
  side panel for reference content). Admin's address and country fields and
  Inventory's holder and supplier pickers now share the one `Combobox`, which
  also keeps the highlighted suggestion in view in a long list. EstimAI's model
  reference opens in the library `Drawer`. Admin's user detail and mileage-rate
  pages read permissions from the shell instead of fetching them again. The
  suite's end-to-end tests look for the current Refund label instead of the old
  "Refund (Rimborsi)".
- 59e9b48: Dependency security update. better-auth moves to 1.7.18 everywhere, closing the advisory that let an OAuth state be used as a magic link to sign in as another user. The frontends move to vitest 4 and refreshed lockfiles, which clears the critical seroval and tinypool advisories. auth gains a migration adding three optional key columns that better-auth 1.7 expects on its signing-key table.
- c383ded: The holder picker's list in the Assign dialog is no longer cut off at the bottom
  of the dialog. Form dialogs now let the page behind them scroll instead of
  scrolling inside themselves.
- 28872b4: One styling dialect across the suite (ADR 20261031-one-styling-dialect-token-utilities): colours and fonts are Tailwind
  utilities generated from the shared design tokens, never inline styles, and a
  lint rule keeps it that way. Hover and focus colours now apply where inline
  colours used to override them, date pickers follow the light theme, EstimAI's
  AI purple and tinted highlights follow the theme too, and each tool's
  standalone build uses the suite's real tokens instead of a stale copy.
- 28872b4: The design system gains `Menu` (the header's logo and account menus, now with
  full keyboard support) and `CheckboxGroupField` (pick several options from a
  list), and `ConfirmDialog` can ask for an acknowledgement and hold fields.
  Refund's "Mark as paid" and Inventory's dispose, close-year and new-rule
  dialogs now share that confirmation; Admin's role and department checklists
  and Inventory's invoice linking share the checkbox group. Success messages
  dismiss themselves after the same time in every tool.
- 28872b4: Keyboard focus is now visible the same way in every tool: a 2px accent ring
  (`--focus-ring`, at least 5.2:1 in both themes) on every focusable element,
  from the shared tokens. It used to exist only in Inventory's standalone build,
  so inside the suite no tool had it.
- c4ba4c3: Pages use more of a wide screen: the default tool column grows from 64rem to 80rem and the wide one (the CRM pipeline) fills the width beside the sidebar; single forms stay at 40rem.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 2b11a53: New Inventory tool (specs/20261006-hardware-inventory): a hardware register with assets, employee-confirmed
  assignment, a depreciation ledger with fiscal-year close, and invoice files.

  `inventory-api` and `inventory-ui` are new. The shell mounts the gated `/inventory` route
  and an ungated `/devices` route (a "My devices" screen for every signed-in user). `auth`
  gains the inventory permission catalog, a scoped service-token endpoint and a capability-gated
  user directory. `notify-api` accepts the scoped service JWT on `/system/notifications` and a new
  `inventory` origin app, which `notify-ui` renders. New environment variables must be set before
  deploying: see `infra/README.md` § `inventory-api` service.

  `auth GET /authz/resolve` now returns no permissions for a soft-deleted user, so a removed
  user loses access to `refund-api` and `inventory-api` within 30 seconds instead of keeping it
  until their token expires.
