/**
 * `POST /activity-host/v1/resolve` (specs/028 T4; plan.md § Host contract, ADR-0081): the host half
 * of "may THIS caller read the activities of these companies?", asked by activities-api.
 *
 * Authenticated with the CALLER's own JWT, forwarded verbatim (ADR-0035 model: no new secret) and
 * resolved live against `auth` on every call (ADR-0014): an `auth` outage is a 503, never a
 * `reader`. Like the meeting-host resolve, the route does NOT carry `requireCapability(crm:access)`:
 * a host answers `reader:false` (a 200), not 403, to a caller who may not read.
 *
 *   crm:access held   -> `reader:true`; each company `open` (label, href, `writable:true`,
 *                        `may.write = may.manage = true`) or `missing`; each related contact/deal
 *                        that belongs to one of the ASKED companies, with its `parentId`.
 *                        Reads are open to every holder (ADR-0052): entity scope plays no part.
 *   crm:access absent -> `reader:false`, no items, no related: nothing about any record leaks,
 *                        not even whether it exists.
 *   `ids: []`         -> only `reader` is answered (no items, no related).
 *
 * A related id that is not found, or whose company is not among the asked ones, is omitted
 * (activities-api turns that into `contact_not_in_company` / `deal_not_in_company`).
 *
 * `entityType: "deal"` (specs/029 T7, AC-2.3): asked by hours-api, as the caller, to decide who may
 * book time on a deal. Same grant and same silence for a non-reader (`reader:false`, no items, so
 * not even whether a deal exists leaks); a reader gets each deal `open` (any stage — won and lost
 * included, A13) or `missing`, with `involved`: the user ids of the deal's owner and, once an
 * estimate is linked, its technical contact (as the deal view reads it) — the CRM's half of "who is
 * involved"; the activities' half (assignees, participants) is asked of activities-api by hours-api.
 * `related` belongs to companies only: sent with a deal it is a 422. The answer is no wider than
 * `GET /deals/{id}`, which shows every `crm:access` holder the same owner and technical contact
 * (ADR-0052).
