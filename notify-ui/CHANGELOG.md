# @operai/notify-ui

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- bc428e8: CRM notifications (specs/20261101-crm-notifications, ADR 20261101-notify-api-resolves-email-notice-address-from-auth):
  - **Notifications:** the CRM notifies people in the app when work is handed to them or concerns them: estimate requests and hand-backs, a new deal owner, an assigned task, a gate override, won and lost deals, a generated offer.
  - **Email notices:** estimate requested, ready or reopened, a new deal owner and an assigned task also send an email, in English. None of them contains any money.
  - **notify-api:** `POST /system/notifications` accepts `email: true`. The caller then needs the `emails.send` scope as well. notify-api looks up the recipient's address in auth and sends the new `notification_notice` email.
  - **auth:** new service endpoint `POST /system/users/contact` and new scope `users.contact`.
  - **Notification center:** `crm` is a new origin, shown in the bell and the notification center.
- 28872b4: Every tool now shares one look for actions, text and page layout: buttons and
  dialogs come from the shared library with the same meaning-based styles
  (primary actions meet contrast everywhere, cancel is quiet, destructive is
  red), text uses one type scale with an 11px minimum, labels drop their "+"
  and arrow prefixes, each tool has the same title bar, tabs and page header on
  a common width scale, and every detail page has a "Back to …" link. EstimAI's
  shortcuts, health and About dialogs are now real modal dialogs.
- 28872b4: The whole suite now speaks Italian as well as English: every tool has a
  complete Italian translation and follows the browser's language, chosen once
  for all tools. Dates read the same everywhere (31.10.2026), amounts show their
  currency code with the language's separators, statuses use one shared set of
  icons and colours so the same symbol always means the same thing, emoji and
  text symbols are replaced by real icons that render on every system, headings
  are in sentence case, loading and empty screens look the same in every tool,
  detail pages are organised in cards, and EstimAI's views are proper tabs.
- c30a110: Bilingual system notifications (specs/20261104-meetings, ADR 20261104-bilingual-system-notifications):
  - **notify-api:** `POST /system/notifications` accepts an optional Italian rendering of the title and body (`it`). A notification without it renders exactly as before. A migration adds the column. Email notices stay English.
  - **notify-ui:** the bell and the notification center show the Italian text when the interface language is Italian and the notification carries it, and fall back to the original otherwise. `meetings` is a new origin.

### Patch Changes

- 4f8e70f: Add activities-api (specs/20261110-activities, ADR 20261110-activities-service-access-delegated-to-host/0082/0083): one backend-only service for the activities, tasks and
  task blockers of the CRM and of Projects, with no permission catalog of its own, so every access decision is
  asked of the host (`crm-api`, `projects-api`) as the caller and fails closed. `crm-api` moves its activities,
  participants, blockers and meeting host state out (they are copied in once by
  `activities-api/scripts/import-crm-activities.ts`, a later push drops the old tables) and calls
  `activities-api` with the new service scope `activities.write`; `projects-api` becomes a host. `auth`
  registers the scope and the `activities-api` service client; `notify-api` accepts the `projects` origin and
  binds `system:activities-api` to `crm` and `projects`; `notify-ui` tags it. The shell trusts the
  activities-api origin; `crm-ui` reads activities from it; `projects-ui` gains a Tasks card on a project and a
  My tasks page.
- 59e9b48: Dependency security update. better-auth moves to 1.7.18 everywhere, closing the advisory that let an OAuth state be used as a magic link to sign in as another user. The frontends move to vitest 4 and refreshed lockfiles, which clears the critical seroval and tinypool advisories. auth gains a migration adding three optional key columns that better-auth 1.7 expects on its signing-key table.
- 28872b4: Tables, paging, forms and feedback now work the same in every tool: record
  lists are accessible data tables, long lists page the same way, every form
  marks required fields with an asterisk and explains errors next to the field
  (moving focus to the first one), amounts accept a comma or a dot, dates use
  the date picker, every save, invite and delete confirms where you acted,
  errors you can retry are orange and errors you must fix are red, EstimAI no
  longer uses browser alert boxes, and the page no longer scrolls behind an open
  dialog.
- 28872b4: One styling dialect across the suite (ADR 20261031-one-styling-dialect-token-utilities): colours and fonts are Tailwind
  utilities generated from the shared design tokens, never inline styles, and a
  lint rule keeps it that way. Hover and focus colours now apply where inline
  colours used to override them, date pickers follow the light theme, EstimAI's
  AI purple and tinted highlights follow the theme too, and each tool's
  standalone build uses the suite's real tokens instead of a stale copy.
- c4ba4c3: Pages use more of a wide screen: the default tool column grows from 64rem to 80rem and the wide one (the CRM pipeline) fills the width beside the sidebar; single forms stay at 40rem.

## 0.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 2b11a53: New Inventory tool (specs/20261006-hardware-inventory): a hardware register with assets, employee-confirmed
  assignment, a depreciation ledger with fiscal-year close, and invoice files.

  `inventory-api` and `inventory-ui` are new. The shell mounts the gated `/inventory` route
  and an ungated `/devices` route (a "My devices" screen for every signed-in user). `auth`
  gains the inventory permission catalog, a scoped service-token endpoint and a capability-gated
  user directory. `notify-api` accepts the scoped service JWT on `/system/notifications` and a new
  `inventory` origin app, which `notify-ui` renders. New environment variables must be set before
  deploying: see `infra/README.md` § `inventory-api` service.

  `auth GET /authz/resolve` now returns no permissions for a soft-deleted user, so a removed
  user loses access to `refund-api` and `inventory-api` within 30 seconds instead of keeping it
  until their token expires.

## 0.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 6a13795: The shell footer/About dialog was showing `@operai/shell`'s own package
  version (`0.0.0`) instead of the Operai suite's umbrella version — the two
  are different numbers, and only the umbrella one is meaningful to a user.
  The footer now reads the umbrella version from a committed, generated file
  (`shell/src/lib/suiteVersion.generated.json`, kept in sync by
  `scripts/version.mjs` at release time) instead of `shell`'s own
  `package.json`.

  The About dialog additionally gains a "Components" section listing each
  mounted remote's own version (EstimAI, Refund, Admin, Notify), each exposed
  via a small new federated `./version` module. A remote whose version can't be
  resolved — unreachable, cold-starting, or (going forward, since every app
  deploys independently) simply predating this change — degrades to a muted
  "—" rather than blocking the dialog or throwing.
