## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 4f8e70f: Add activities-api (specs/20261110-activities, ADR 20261110-activities-service-access-delegated-to-host/0082/0083): one backend-only service for the activities, tasks and
  task blockers of the CRM and of Projects, with no permission catalog of its own, so every access decision is
  asked of the host (`crm-api`, `projects-api`) as the caller and fails closed. `crm-api` moves its activities,
  participants, blockers and meeting host state out (they are copied in once by
  `activities-api/scripts/import-crm-activities.ts`, a later push drops the old tables) and calls
  `activities-api` with the new service scope `activities.write`; `projects-api` becomes a host. `auth`
  registers the scope and the `activities-api` service client; `notify-api` accepts the `projects` origin and
  binds `system:activities-api` to `crm` and `projects`; `notify-ui` tags it. The shell trusts the
  activities-api origin; `crm-ui` reads activities from it; `projects-ui` gains a Tasks card on a project and a
  My tasks page.
- 4f8e70f: Add the Projects module (specs/20261103-projects, ADR 20261103-projects-tool-shape-and-authorization/0080): the delivery work wellD runs. A
  project has a type (T&M, fixed price, maintenance, SaaS, internal), a state, a project manager and
  a team; its contracts record what each client bought as structured delivery terms (deadline and
  max effort, SLA, hour package, T&M positions, licence period), and `accounting` records the Bexio
  order id on each contract. No money anywhere in the module. New services `projects-api` and
  `projects-ui`; the shell mounts the tool at `/projects`.
  - **auth:** registers the `projects` catalog (`projects:access`, entity-scoped `project:manage`,
    `contract:bexio`) and the `project-manager` role; `sales` gains access and entity-scoped manage,
    `accounting` gains access and the Bexio order capability; `project:manage` holders can read the
    user directory; new service scope `crm.companies.read`.
  - **crm-api:** new `GET /system/companies`, readable only with a service credential carrying
    `crm.companies.read` (the first `/system/*` route on the CRM).
- 48de67f: Tasks have a rich description with pictures and attachments (ADR 20261113-task-description-files-in-activities-api-bucket). In the CRM and in Projects a task's text is now formatted (bold, lists, check lists…); pictures can be chosen, pasted or dropped into it, and files (PDF, Office, text, CSV, pictures) attached under it. Files are uploaded when the task is saved, live in activities-api's own EU bucket and are shown to whoever can read the task. A task's existing plain text becomes its description.

### Patch Changes

- 039ba3f: Lists no longer blank to a loading skeleton when you come back to them or when they reload after a change: they show what was last loaded at once and refresh it in the background (Meetings list, templates and folders; CRM companies, contacts, pipeline and tasks; Projects list and My tasks). Kept in memory only, for the open tab.
- f494bbc: Pin `@tanstack/react-router` to 1.170.17 like every other frontend, so the suite resolves one router for the Module Federation singleton (specs/20261111-push-notifications E-1).
- c4ba4c3: Pages use more of a wide screen: the default tool column grows from 64rem to 80rem and the wide one (the CRM pipeline) fills the width beside the sidebar; single forms stay at 40rem.
