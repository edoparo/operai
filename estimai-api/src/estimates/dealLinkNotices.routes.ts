/**
 * POST /system/deal-link-notices — crm-api tells EstimAI which CRM deal an
 * estimate belongs to, or that it no longer does (specs/20261108-estimate-list-oversight US-3, AC-3.3,
 * AC-3.5, AC-3.6; ADR 20261108-crm-pushes-deal-links-to-estimai, the mirror of ADR 20261105-estimai-closes-the-estimate-crm-follows). EstimAI keeps the link as
 * two columns, `crmDealId` and `crmLinkAt`, and shows the deal on the list.
 *
 * Service-to-service only: a service JWT of `system:crm-api` with scope
 * `deal-link-notices.send`, `aud = SERVICE_AUDIENCE` (systemAuth). The body is
 * three ids and an instant — never anything of the deal (title, amount, notes),
 * and an unknown field is a 400. An estimate EstimAI does not have answers 204
 * like any other, so nothing is learnt from it.
 *
 * ORDER (AC-3.6). Notices may arrive late, twice or out of order, so each one is
 * applied by ONE conditional UPDATE keyed on the CRM instant `at` (every `at`
 * comes from crm-api's one clock) — no read-then-write:
 *   - `linked` applies when `crmLinkAt` is null or older than `at`;
 *   - `unlinked` applies when `crmLinkAt` is null or not newer than `at`, so at
 *     an equal instant the unlink wins;
 *   - `unlinked` clears only a link to the notice's own deal. Where the
 *     estimate holds NO link yet it still records `at`, so the `linked` it
 *     undoes cannot land afterwards. Where it is linked to a DIFFERENT deal it
 *     changes nothing at all, `crmLinkAt` included: advancing it would shut out
 *     the newer link's own notice if that arrives late. (The CRM never relinks
 *     an estimate — a new request is a new estimate, specs/20261101-crm-sales-flow AC-3.1 — so that
 *     branch is a guard, not a flow.)
 *
 * Raw SQL, not `updateMany`: Prisma's `@updatedAt` would stamp the estimate as
 * edited, reordering the list and implying a change to the document. A link is
 * not one.
