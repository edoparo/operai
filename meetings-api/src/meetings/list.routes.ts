/**
 * `GET /meetings`: "My meetings" (specs/021-meetings plan.md § API contracts → Meetings;
 * AC-10.1, AC-10.2, AC-10.3, AC-11.5). Every signed-in user gets it, with no grant at all
 * and while `auth` is down (`selfScoped`, AC-10.6).
 *
 * The list is the caller's own: meetings they created, and meetings they were added to as
 * an Operai participant. Nothing else, whatever they hold: an administrator, an erase holder
 * and a host reader (who opens a meeting through its host entity, not from here) see only
 * their own (AC-4.8). Newest first, 25 a page.
 *
 * `status` filters on the DERIVED status: `interrupted` is never stored, so the rows still
 * `recording` are partitioned with the same `derivedStatus` the rows are shown with. That
 * set is the caller's few live recordings, never a page worth.
 *
 * `ids` (at most 25, specs/029 AC-2.5, AC-2.10) is one more filter, ANDed with the caller's own
 * set like the rest: hours-api asks it "which of these meetings may this person record hours on,
 * and what are they called". Only a meeting the caller created or was added to as an Operai
 * participant comes back; one they could open only through its host, someone else's, and an id
 * that does not exist are all simply absent, with nothing to tell them apart.
