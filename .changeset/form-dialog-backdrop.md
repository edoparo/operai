A click outside a form dialog no longer closes it and throws away what was typed: `FormDialog` ignores the backdrop, and Cancel, × and Escape still close it. `Dialog` gains `dismissOnBackdrop` for the same behaviour, which the estimate's collaborators dialog and the refund reject dialog now use. In every dialog and drawer, a text selection that starts inside and is released outside no longer counts as a click on the backdrop.
