EstimAI list (specs/20261108-estimate-list-oversight): an admin can list and open every estimate read-only (new `estimate:read-all` permission, seeded to `admin`; ADR 20261108-estimai-oversight-permission-amends-0036); closed estimates move from the default Open list to a Closed filter; an estimate linked to a CRM deal shows a Deal badge, kept up to date by crm-api's new deal-link notices (scope `deal-link-notices.send`, ADR 20261108-crm-pushes-deal-links-to-estimai). Deploy auth first, then add the scope to crm-api's `SERVICE_CLIENTS` entry, set `SERVICE_AUDIENCE` on estimai-api and `ESTIMAI_INTERNAL_URL` on crm-api, deploy both, and run `crm-api/scripts/backfill-estimate-links.ts --apply` once.
