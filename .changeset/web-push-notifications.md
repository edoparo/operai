Add desktop push notifications (specs/029, ADR-0084/0085/0086/0087): `notify-api` gains a Web Push channel with encrypted payloads (no Firebase), a `push_device` table, the user-JWT routes `GET /push/config`, `PUT`/`GET /push/devices` and `DELETE /push/devices/{id}`, and the settings `PUSH_ENABLED` (off by default), `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY`, `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY`, `VAPID_SUBJECT` and `PUSH_EXCLUDED_ORIGINS`. It remembers a recipient's active answer for 30 s, shares one in-flight lookup per user and sends through a bounded pool. The shell serves the `/push-sw.js` service worker, releases the device on sign-out, and adds a push section to My profile to turn push on or off and to list and remove devices. Rotating the VAPID keys invalidates every subscription; see infra/README.md.

`auth` limits `POST /system/service-token` and `POST /system/users/contact` per verified calling service instead of per address: new optional variables `SERVICE_TOKEN_SERVICE_LIMIT` (300), `USERS_CONTACT_SERVICE_LIMIT` (600), `SYSTEM_INVALID_CREDENTIAL_LIMIT` (20 invalid credentials per address) and `SYSTEM_RATE_WINDOW_MS` (600000), a 4 KiB body cap and a 4 096-character token cap, and one 429 with `Retry-After`. `SERVICE_TOKEN_RATE_LIMIT` and `SERVICE_TOKEN_RATE_WINDOW_MS` are retired: ignored with one startup warning, flagged by env-doctor; delete them from production once this `auth` is live. Deploy `auth` first and enable `PUSH_ENABLED` only after the live capacity re-measure (infra/README.md § Push notifications).
