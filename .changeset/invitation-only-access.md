Operai is now invitation-only. Signing in creates a user only for an email in an allowed domain (`ALLOWED_SIGNUP_DOMAINS`) that holds a valid invitation; an allowed-domain email without one sees a page explaining this and joins a waiting list, and an outside-domain email is refused with nothing recorded. Admins review these requests in a new waiting list in the Admin tool and approve one into an invitation or dismiss it, and are notified of new requests.
