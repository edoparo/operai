/**
 * strings — every user-visible string of admin-ui (INC-24), in English and
 * Italian (INC-25). Components import `strings` and never inline copy;
 * `lib/noHardcodedStrings.test.ts` scans every `.tsx` under `src/` for that,
 * and `strings.test.ts` checks the Italian catalog is complete.
 *
 * One file per area under `./strings/`, each exporting its `en` catalog and an
 * `it` typed as it. The language is resolved once, by `@operai/ui`'s
 * `selectStrings` (`<html lang>` set by the shell, else the browser's
 * preferred languages, else English) — this app never detects it itself.
