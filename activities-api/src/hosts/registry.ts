/**
 * The host registry (specs/028-activities plan.md § Access, ADR-0081). A host is DATA, never a
 * branch in a route: each rule that differs between the CRM and Projects (who edits, who
 * completes, who may be assigned, which types exist) is a field below, read by the routes of
 * T7-T9 without an `if (app === "crm")`. Same shape as meetings-api `hosts/registry.ts`.
 *
 * Production and test hold the SAME two hosts. A test points them at a scriptable test host by
 * building the registry from the test host's URL (`buildRegistry`, `setRegistryForTests`),
 * which is why there is no `*_TEST_HOSTS` variable here to refuse in production.
 *
 * This file also holds the TYPES of the host contract (`HostEntity`, `ResolveResult`), so
 * `client.ts` exports nothing but its function.
