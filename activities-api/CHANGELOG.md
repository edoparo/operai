## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 4f8e70f: Add activities-api (specs/20261110-activities, ADR 20261110-activities-service-access-delegated-to-host/0082/0083): one backend-only service for the activities, tasks and
  task blockers of the CRM and of Projects, with no permission catalog of its own, so every access decision is
  asked of the host (`crm-api`, `projects-api`) as the caller and fails closed. `crm-api` moves its activities,
  participants, blockers and meeting host state out (they are copied in once by
  `activities-api/scripts/import-crm-activities.ts`, a later push drops the old tables) and calls
  `activities-api` with the new service scope `activities.write`; `projects-api` becomes a host. `auth`
  registers the scope and the `activities-api` service client; `notify-api` accepts the `projects` origin and
  binds `system:activities-api` to `crm` and `projects`; `notify-ui` tags it. The shell trusts the
  activities-api origin; `crm-ui` reads activities from it; `projects-ui` gains a Tasks card on a project and a
  My tasks page.
- 48de67f: Tasks have a rich description with pictures and attachments (ADR 20261113-task-description-files-in-activities-api-bucket). In the CRM and in Projects a task's text is now formatted (bold, lists, check lists…); pictures can be chosen, pasted or dropped into it, and files (PDF, Office, text, CSV, pictures) attached under it. Files are uploaded when the task is saved, live in activities-api's own EU bucket and are shown to whoever can read the task. A task's existing plain text becomes its description.
