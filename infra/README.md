# Operai — Deployment Guide

The single, step-by-step guide to installing the Operai suite: **frontends on
Vercel**, **backends + Postgres on Railway**. It replaces the previous
per-platform runbooks and variable reference (all folded in below).

Two helper scripts live beside this doc:

| Script | What it does |
|---|---|
| **`./infra/deploy.sh`** | Automates the automatable: Railway backend vars + deploys (+ optional `--vercel` env sync). |
| **`./infra/check.sh`** | Verifies an install — local tooling and/or deployed health (backends, JWKS, remotes, CSP). |

> **Data residency (hard requirement).** All **backend** services and Postgres
> run in **`europe-west4`** (Railway EU). Some wellD clients are regulated
> (energy/finance/health). Don't change the region without an ADR + client
> sign-off. Frontends are static client bundles; they store/transmit no estimate
> data except the browser's authenticated calls to the EU backends.

```

- **Frontends:** the `shell` is the human entry point (`operai.welld.io`); the
  four tools (`estimai-ui`, `refund-ui`, `admin-ui`, `notify-ui`) are
  runtime-federated remotes, each on its own subdomain, loaded cross-origin by
  the shell (ADR-0006). `notify-ui` (specs/005) is the notification-center
  page; the shell's own bell/toast/SSE seam is shipped inside the shell bundle
  itself, not this remote (ADR-0009) — see the shell-side notes in
  `specs/005-notification-center/plan.md`.
- **Backends:** `auth` (OAuth, sessions, RS256 JWT + JWKS, hosted sign-in,
  authorization/admin API), `estimai-api` (estimate persistence), `notify-api`
  (notification persistence + SSE push, specs/005), and `refund-api`
  (reimbursement persistence + authorization-enforcing resource server,
  specs/007). One Postgres instance, four logical databases (`auth`,
  `estimai`, `notify`, `refund`); service↔DB traffic stays on Railway private
  networking (`*.railway.internal`).
  **`notify-api` is pinned to a single replica** (`.railway/railway.ts`,
  `replicas: { "europe-west4-drams3a": 1 }`) — its in-process EventBus fan-out and stream-ticket store
  are correct for exactly one running instance (plan.md Risk R2). Do not
  enable autoscale/multiple replicas for this service without first moving
  both seams onto Postgres `LISTEN`/`NOTIFY` + a shared ticket table.
  `refund-api` has no equivalent constraint — its `authzMiddleware` cache
  (ADR-0014) is a per-replica performance optimization with a 30s TTL
  backstop, not a correctness-dependent single-instance store.
  **`auth` and `estimai-api` are now ALSO pinned to a single replica each**
  (specs/013-estimate-sharing, T13, plan.md Risk R7) — `auth`'s
  `APP_ACCESS_CHECK_*` rate limiter (T1, `src/lib/rateLimiter.ts`) and
  `estimai-api`'s `SHARE_ADD_*` rate limiter + 60s in-process identity cache
  (T5, `src/lib/rateLimiter.ts`/`authClient.ts`) are both `Map`-based,
  per-process state — a second replica of either service would silently
  multiply the effective rate limit by the replica count (an attacker
  round-robined across N replicas gets N× the intended budget) and serve a
  stale identity from whichever replica's cache happens to answer. Same
  failure shape as `notify-api`'s SSE constraint above, same fix if this is
  ever revisited: swap the `Map` for a shared store (Redis/Postgres) behind
  the limiter's existing one-interface design (plan.md R7 "Early check") —
  do not enable autoscale/multiple replicas for `auth` or `estimai-api`
  without doing that first. The pins live in `.railway/railway.ts`
  (§ Railway configuration as code below).
- **`notify-api` and `estimai-api` are cross-valid JWKS resource servers**
  (ADR-0010) — both verify the same `auth`-issued tokens, so both (plus
  `auth`, which stamps the claim) require an identical **`AUTH_AUDIENCE`**
  value or a token minted for one is structurally valid at the other.
  `refund-api` (specs/007) is a THIRD JWKS resource server on the same
  `AUTH_AUDIENCE` value — see § Variable reference.
- **`auth` → `notify-api` service-to-service email trigger** (specs/006-user-invitations,
  ADR-0011): `auth` calls `notify-api`'s internal `POST /system/emails` to send
  invite/resend emails (Resend, bilingual) — the suite's first non-user-JWT
  cross-service call. Since specs/016 (ADR-0048/0049) `auth` authenticates it with its
  own scoped 5-minute service JWT (`sub=system:auth`, scope `emails.send`), minted in
  process — there is no shared secret any more. This call is routed over Railway **private
  networking** (`NOTIFY_INTERNAL_URL` → `notify-api.railway.internal`), not
  the public `<NOTIFY_API_URL>` domain the browser uses for SSE — see
  § Variable reference and § Phase 1 step 7.
- **`refund-api` → `auth` `/authz/resolve` + `refund-api` → `notify-api`
  `/system/notifications`** (specs/007-refund-service, ADR-0014/ADR-0017):
  `refund-api` is the suite's first AUTHORIZATION-enforcing resource server —
  every request resolves the caller's live permissions from `auth GET
  /authz/resolve` (forwarding the caller's own Bearer JWT, no new secret,
  reuses `AUTH_ISSUER`/`AUTH_JWKS_URL`/`AUTH_AUDIENCE` below — no separate env
  var). After an approve/reject decision it calls `notify-api`'s internal
  `POST /system/notifications` (mirrors `/system/emails`'s shape), and, for the
  monthly batch email, `POST /system/emails`, each authenticated with its own scoped
  service JWT (scopes `notifications.push` + `emails.send`) from `auth POST
  /system/service-token` (ADR-0049). Both calls should
  prefer Railway **private networking** where the target service's private
  hostname is known, same posture as `auth`'s existing `NOTIFY_INTERNAL_URL`.
- **`refund-api` → EU object storage** (specs/007-refund-service, ADR-0016): a
  SEPARATE S3-compatible bucket resource (not a Railway service) — receipt
  attachments never transit `refund-api`'s own process (presigned
  direct-to-bucket upload/download). See § Variable reference's `refund-api`
  section and this task's follow-up note on provisioning (not yet done).
- **`estimai-api` → `auth` `/authz/app-access-check` + `/authz/users/identities`,
  `estimai-api` → `notify-api` `/system/notifications`** (specs/013-estimate-sharing,
  T13, ADR-0035/ADR-0036/ADR-0039/ADR-0040): estimate sharing (US-1..US-7)
  adds `estimai-api`'s first outbound calls to two sibling services, using
  its own `AUTH_BASE_URL` env var (a NEW var — distinct from the
  pre-existing `AUTH_ISSUER`/`AUTH_JWKS_URL` claim-verification values).
  Both `auth` calls forward the CALLER's own Bearer JWT (no new credential;
  `POST /authz/app-access-check` fails CLOSED on error per ADR-0035,
  `POST /authz/users/identities` fails SOFT to `status:"unknown"` per
  ADR-0039 — deliberately different failure postures on the same service,
  see each ADR). `estimai-api` deliberately does **not** become an
  authorization-enforcing resource server like `refund-api` (ADR-0036) —
  per-record ACLs live in `estimai-api`'s own `estimate_collaborator` table,
  not in `auth`'s catalog. The `notify-api` call reuses `refund-api`'s exact
  `/system/notifications` contract, authenticated with `estimai-api`'s own
  scoped service JWT (scope `notifications.push` only; ADR-0049 — see
  § "Service clients" below). Both calls are additionally bounded by
  `estimai-api`'s own `SHARE_ADD_RATE_LIMIT`/`_WINDOW_MS` and
  `SHARE_LOOKUP_FLOOR_MS` (plan.md AC-1.2's anti-enumeration timing floor,
  mirroring `auth`'s own `APP_ACCESS_CHECK_FLOOR_MS`) — see § Variable
  reference's `estimai-api` section for all six new vars.
- **The public URL placeholders** used below — keep them straight; all need
  the `https://` scheme:
  - `<AUTH_URL>` = the **auth** service (e.g. `https://auth.operai.welld.io`). It
    is the JWT **issuer**, so `estimai-api`, `notify-api`, and `refund-api`
    point back at it (`refund-api` also calls its `/authz/resolve` route).
  - `<API_URL>` = the **estimai-api** service (e.g. `https://estimai-api.operai.welld.io`).
    Only the browser/UI references it.
  - `<NOTIFY_API_URL>` = the **notify-api** service's **public** domain (e.g.
    `https://notify-api.operai.welld.io`). Only the browser/UI references it
    (via `VITE_NOTIFY_API_URL`); it is also the origin the shell CSP's
    `connect-src` must allow for the SSE `EventSource` (R6 — see Phase 3).
  - `<NOTIFY_INTERNAL_URL>` = notify-api's Railway **private**-networking
    address, written as `http://operai.railway.internal:8080`
    (notify-api's real private host is `operai.railway.internal`, NOT
    `notify-api.railway.internal` — see the ⚠ box in § Cross-service wiring) —
    distinct from `<NOTIFY_API_URL>` above. `auth`'s server-side `POST /system/emails` call
    (specs/006-user-invitations, ADR-0011) AND `refund-api`'s server-side
    `POST /system/notifications` call (specs/007, ADR-0017) both use this;
    never given to a browser, never the public domain — see § Phase 1 step 7.
  - `<INVENTORY_API_URL>` = the **inventory-api** service's **public** domain
    (e.g. `https://inventory-api.operai.welld.io`). Only the browser references it,
    through the shell's `VITE_INVENTORY_API_URL` (inventory-ui has no copy of its
    own) and the shell CSP's `connect-src`.
  - `<REFUND_API_URL>` = the **refund-api** service's **public** domain (e.g.
    `https://refund-api.operai.welld.io`). Only the browser/UI references it
    (via `VITE_REFUND_API_URL`, both on the `shell` project — trusted-origins
    allowlist — and the `refund-ui` project itself); it is also the origin
    the shell CSP's `connect-src` must allow (see Phase 3).

- **`inventory-api` and `inventory-ui`** (specs/015-hardware-inventory, T43;
  ADR-0044..0047) are the fifth backend and sixth frontend project. The diagram
  above predates them; they add a sixth Vercel project (`inventory-ui` →
  `inventory.operai.welld.io`, a remote exposing `./App`, `./MyDevices` and
  `./version`), a fifth Railway service (`inventory-api` → `inventory-api.operai.welld.io`,
  logical DB `inventory`, port `8083`, region `europe-west4`) and a SEPARATE EU
  invoice bucket. `inventory-api` is an authorization-enforcing resource server
  (calls `auth GET /authz/resolve` and `POST /authz/users/identities` on the
  caller's forwarded JWT) and the one of four notify callers: it pushes to
  `notify-api POST /system/notifications` with a 5-minute scoped service JWT
  minted by `auth POST /system/service-token` (ADR-0044/0049). Browsers also call
  `auth GET /authz/users/directory` directly from `inventory-ui` (ADR-0047).
  Full variable list and the manual rollout steps: § `inventory-api` service.
- **Service tokens are signed by better-auth's rotating key, NOT by
  `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY`** (ADR-0044, plan risk R-4, resolved in the T4 contract
  test): the token carries the same `kid` that `auth` publishes at
  `/auth/jwks`, and `notify-api` verifies it against its existing `AUTH_JWKS_URL`
  (`aud = SERVICE_AUDIENCE`, `scope` containing `notifications.push`). The
  static pair served at `/.well-known/jwks.json` signs nothing here — do not
  point anything at it for this flow, and do not rotate `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY`
  expecting it to affect service tokens.

**Hostnames.** The `*.operai.welld.io` scheme is the proposed, welld.io-parented
layout (shared registrable parent matters for the credentialed `/auth/token`
cookie call — ADR-0001 R7). If the real domains differ, update them here **and**
in the static `vercel.json` CSP/redirect strings (Vercel doesn't interpolate env
vars into those).

---

## Prerequisites

1. **Tooling:** `railway` CLI (logged in: `railway login`), `vercel` CLI (logged
   in: `vercel login`) if you want Vercel automation, **direnv**, the **1Password
   CLI** (`op`, signed in), Node 24 + `pnpm`, and `bun`. Verify with
   **`./infra/check.sh --prereqs`**.
2. **Secrets (direnv + 1Password).** Backend secrets never live in the repo —
   they load from 1Password via `.envrc`. Run `direnv allow auth` (and
   `direnv allow estimai-api`, `direnv allow notify-api`, `direnv allow
   refund-api`) once, be signed in to `op`, and run deploy commands from
   within that shell (e.g. `direnv exec auth ./infra/deploy.sh`) so the
   secrets are exported. The full variable → 1Password-item map is in
   **§ Variable reference** below. **`refund-api`'s object-storage
   credentials (`REFUND_S3_*`) have NO 1Password item yet** — provision a real
   EU-region bucket first (see § Variable reference's `refund-api` section);
   `deploy.sh` does not yet set these vars automatically for that reason.
3. **Railway project** exists (its id is in 1Password as `$RAILWAY_PROJECT_ID`).
   Creating the project + attaching custom domains is a one-time dashboard action.

---

## Order of operations

Each phase feeds the next, so do them in order:

1. **Railway — backends first.** Yields `<AUTH_URL>`, `<API_URL>`, `<NOTIFY_API_URL>`, and `<REFUND_API_URL>`.
2. **Vercel — the five frontends.** Their build-time vars point at the Phase-1 URLs.
3. **Cross-wire origins + OAuth.** Backends trust the shell origin; register OAuth redirects.
4. **Verify** end-to-end (`./infra/check.sh`).

**Chicken-and-egg, resolved:** the shell's production origin is fixed in advance
(`https://operai.welld.io`), so the backends' `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`/`UI_HOME_URL` can
be set in Phase 1 without waiting for Vercel. Only the three **backend** URLs
are discovered during deploy — which is why the frontends' vars come after.

---

## Railway configuration as code (ADR-0088)

The Railway project — every backend service, the shared Postgres and its volume, the
buckets, custom domains, build and deploy settings, replicas and region — is declared in
**`.railway/railway.ts`** (Railway IaC, TypeScript SDK `railway`, pinned in the root
`package.json`). It replaces the per-service `railway.json` files (Config as Code,
deprecated, no longer read after 2026-12-01), migrated on 2026-11-13 and removed.

```bash
pnpm install                      # once, at the repo root: the SDK the CLI evaluates the file with
railway link -p 3bafd4c0-226f-4621-821b-a063976498a2 -e production
railway config plan               # read-only: what would change
railway config apply              # re-plans, shows the diff, asks for confirmation
```

Rules:

- **Change the file, not the dashboard.** A dashboard edit is drift: the next plan
  shows it and the next apply undoes it. `railway config plan --detailed-exit-code`
  exits `2` when Railway and the file differ (the scheduled `railway-drift` workflow
  runs it).
- **Plan before apply, commit before apply.** What is applied must be what is in git.
- **Never `--confirm-destructive` without reading the plan.** In a single-file setup a
  resource missing from the file is DELETED by the apply — the Postgres, its volume and
  the buckets included. A destructive plan is a stop, never a flag to add.
- **Region stays `europe-west4-drams3a`** (services, Postgres, volume) and **`ams`**
  (buckets) — data residency. A bucket's region cannot change after creation.
- **Variables are not managed** (`variables: { managed: false }`): the file holds no
  value and no secret; variables stay in Railway (dashboard, `deploy.sh`,
  `provision-tool.sh`). Making them managed would put every name under the file and a
  removed name would be deleted — a separate decision.
- **Single-replica services stay at 1**: `notify-api`, `meetings-api`, `auth`,
  `estimai-api` (see § Topology). Every other service is also declared at 1 today.
- The migration's undo snapshot (`.railway/.cac-migration.json`) is local only and
  ignored by git; after 2026-12-01 there is nothing to undo to.

## Phase 1 — Railway backends

The shape of every service — build, start, healthcheck, pre-deploy, replicas, region,
custom domain, root directory — is **`.railway/railway.ts`** (§ above), applied with
`railway config apply`; the steps below that say "pin", "root dir" or "domain" are
already declared there. What is left to this phase is what IaC does not manage: the
logical databases and the **variables**. The automatable parts of that are in
**`./infra/deploy.sh`**; the manual bits are called out. Step by step:

1. **Link** the project: `railway link "$RAILWAY_PROJECT_ID"` (env `production`).
2. **Postgres**: declared in `.railway/railway.ts` (`postgres("Postgres", { region:
   "europe-west4-drams3a" })` plus its volume) — never removed from the file, an
   apply would delete it. Then create the
   four logical DBs (the script attempts this; or `railway connect Postgres` →
   `CREATE DATABASE auth;` `CREATE DATABASE estimai;` `CREATE DATABASE notify;`
   `CREATE DATABASE refund;`). They must exist before the first deploy — each
   service's `preDeploy` runs `prisma migrate deploy` against its own DB.
3. **Deploy `auth`** (root dir `auth`, settings in `.railway/railway.ts`): set its vars
   (DATABASE_URL via `${{Postgres.*}}` references, `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`,
   `GOOGLE_*`/`GITHUB_*`, `JWT_*`, `ALLOWED_ORIGINS=<shell origin>`, `UI_HOME_URL`,
   `AUTH_AUDIENCE` (ADR-0010 — one suite-wide value; see below),
   `NOTIFY_INTERNAL_URL` (specs/006-user-invitations, ADR-0011 — see below),
   `SERVICE_AUDIENCE` + `SERVICE_CLIENTS` (ADR-0044/0049 — see § "Service clients"
   below), `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL`, `NODE_ENV=production`, and —
   **optional, code defaults apply if unset (specs/013-estimate-sharing,
   T1/T2/T27)** — `APP_ACCESS_CHECK_FLOOR_MS`/`APP_ACCESS_CHECK_RATE_LIMIT`/
   `APP_ACCESS_CHECK_RATE_WINDOW_MS` and `IDENTITIES_RATE_LIMIT`/
   `IDENTITIES_RATE_WINDOW_MS`), then deploy. Pin **one replica**
   (`.railway/railway.ts` — plan.md Risk R7, see § Topology above; the
   in-process `APP_ACCESS_CHECK`/`IDENTITIES` rate limiters are per-instance
   state). Its custom domain `auth.operai.welld.io` is declared in
   `.railway/railway.ts` → this is **`<AUTH_URL>`**.
4. **Deploy `estimai-api`** (root dir `estimai-api`): set `DATABASE_URL` (dbname
   `estimai`), `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, `AUTH_ISSUER=<AUTH_URL>`,
   `AUTH_JWKS_URL=<AUTH_URL>/auth/jwks`, `AUTH_AUDIENCE` (byte-for-byte identical
   to `auth`'s), `NODE_ENV`, and — **NEW (specs/013-estimate-sharing, T13)** —
   `AUTH_BASE_URL` (internal, bucket ① — same private-DNS shape as
   `refund-api`'s own `AUTH_BASE_URL`, see step 8 below), `NOTIFY_INTERNAL_URL`
   (internal, set at step 8 alongside `auth`'s and `refund-api`'s),
   `SERVICE_CLIENT_ID`/`SERVICE_CLIENT_SECRET` (specs/016 — see § "Service
   clients" below), and `SHARE_LOOKUP_FLOOR_MS`/
   `SHARE_ADD_RATE_LIMIT`/`SHARE_ADD_RATE_WINDOW_MS` (optional — code
   defaults `300`/`20`/`600000` apply if unset). Pin **one replica**
   (`.railway/railway.ts` — plan.md Risk R7, see § Topology above; the
   in-process share-add rate limiter and identity cache are per-instance
   state). **Generate its domain** → **`<API_URL>`**.
5. **Deploy `notify-api`** (root dir `notify-api`, settings in `.railway/railway.ts`
   — note it pins **one replica**, do not change this without first reading
   plan.md Risk R2): set `DATABASE_URL` (dbname `notify`, **not** `estimai`),
   `ALLOWED_ORIGINS=<shell origin>`, `AUTH_ISSUER=<AUTH_URL>`,
   `AUTH_JWKS_URL=<AUTH_URL>/auth/jwks`, `AUTH_AUDIENCE` (same value as the other
   two), `MAX_STREAM_DURATION` (seconds; default `1800`),
   `SERVICE_AUDIENCE` (same value as `auth`'s — see § "Service clients" below),
   `EMAIL_ENABLED`/`RESEND_API_KEY`/`RESEND_FROM` (specs/006-user-invitations —
   see below), `NODE_ENV=production`. Confirm region **`europe-west4`** (data
   residency — notification bodies may name clients/estimates and must stay
   EU-only, never logged). **Generate its domain** → this is
   **`<NOTIFY_API_URL>`** (public — browser/SSE only; see step 7 for the
   private URL `auth` uses instead).

   > ⚠️ **Build fails with `Corepack is about to download … pnpm-…tgz` (exit 1)?**
   > That means Railway ignored the service's Dockerfile and fell back to
   > **Nixpacks**, which scans the monorepo and tries to corepack-install pnpm.
   > Root cause: the service's **Root Directory is not set to the app dir**, so
   > Railway builds from the repo root (which has no Dockerfile/`package.json`).
   > **Fix:** the service's block in `.railway/railway.ts` must declare
   > `source: github(..., { rootDirectory: "/<app>" })` and `builder: "DOCKERFILE"`;
   > `railway config plan` shows the difference, `railway config apply` restores it
   > (a dashboard fix would be undone by the next apply). This applies to BOTH
   > GitHub-connected deploys and `deploy.sh`'s `railway up --service <svc>` (which
   > uploads the repo root as context; the root directory is what scopes the build
   > down to the app).
6. **Deploy `refund-api`** (root dir `refund-api`, settings in `.railway/railway.ts`
   — T19, specs/007-refund-service): set `DATABASE_URL` (dbname `refund`,
   **not** `estimai`/`notify`), `ALLOWED_ORIGINS=<shell origin>`,
   `AUTH_ISSUER=<AUTH_URL>`, `AUTH_JWKS_URL=<AUTH_URL>/auth/jwks`,
   `AUTH_AUDIENCE` (same value as the other three), `NOTIFY_INTERNAL_URL`
   (notify-api's **private**-networking address — same value as `auth`'s, see
   step 8), `SERVICE_CLIENT_ID`/`SERVICE_CLIENT_SECRET` (specs/016 — see
   § "Service clients" below), `REFUND_S3_ENDPOINT`/`REFUND_S3_REGION`/`REFUND_S3_BUCKET`/
   `REFUND_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID`/`REFUND_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` (EU-region object
   storage, ADR-0016 — **NOT YET PROVISIONED**, see § Variable reference),
   `REFUND_APP_BASE_URL` (monthly batch processing, T14,
   specs/008-refund-monthly-processing, ADR-0021 — see § Variable
   reference), `NODE_ENV=production`. Do **NOT** set
   `REFUND_ACCOUNTING_DISTRIBUTION_EMAIL` — as of specs/011-refund-settings
   this is no longer a `refund-api` env var at all (AC-4.1); see
   § "Cutover — accounting-distribution-email setting" below for the
   one-time post-deploy step that replaces it. Confirm region
   **`europe-west4`** (data residency —
   this service handles financial figures and receipt-attachment metadata that
   may carry PII, never logged). **Generate its domain** → this is
   **`<REFUND_API_URL>`**.
7. **Cross-wire:** set `auth`'s `BETTER_AUTH_URL=<AUTH_URL>` (the JWT `iss` claim —
   must equal `estimai-api.AUTH_ISSUER`, `notify-api.AUTH_ISSUER`, and
   `refund-api.AUTH_ISSUER`) and redeploy `auth`. Re-run the script with
   `AUTH_PUBLIC_URL=<AUTH_URL>` once the domain exists.
8. **Wire the invitation email channel + refund decision notifications +
   estimate-sharing notifications** (specs/006-user-invitations ADR-0011,
   specs/007-refund-service ADR-0017, specs/013-estimate-sharing ADR-0040):
   set `auth`'s, `refund-api`'s, **and now `estimai-api`'s**
   `NOTIFY_INTERNAL_URL` to notify-api's **Railway private** networking
   address, as the reference
   `http://operai.railway.internal:8080` —
   do NOT hand-type `notify-api.railway.internal`, which does not resolve
   (the label is declared in `.railway/railway.ts`, notify-api's
   `networking: { privateNetworkEndpoint: "operai" }` → `operai.railway.internal`; see the ⚠
   box in § Cross-service wiring) — **not** `<NOTIFY_API_URL>`, the public domain from step 5
   (plan.md Risk R2 / ADR-0011: this service-to-service call must stay off
   the public internet). Every caller authenticates with its own credential — set up
   the service clients as described in § "Service clients" below (no shared
   secret). Also set `estimai-api`'s `AUTH_BASE_URL` to
   `http://${{auth.RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN}}:${{auth.PORT}}` here (same
   private-DNS shape as `refund-api`'s own `AUTH_BASE_URL` two rows up in §
   Variable reference's ① table) — it is the base for `estimai-api`'s
   `POST /authz/app-access-check` and `POST /authz/users/identities` calls
   (specs/013-estimate-sharing, ADR-0035/0039). Set `notify-api`'s
   `EMAIL_ENABLED=true` with real `RESEND_API_KEY`/`RESEND_FROM` only once
   the Resend sending domain is verified (see § Resend domain setup below) —
   until then, leave `EMAIL_ENABLED=false` so invite emails are stubbed
   (recorded, not actually sent) rather than failing loudly.

**`AUTH_AUDIENCE` (ADR-0010) — one value, FOUR services (as of specs/007).**
`notify-api` was the suite's first real second JWKS resource server, so a
token minted for `estimai-api` would otherwise be structurally valid at
`notify-api` (and vice versa); `refund-api` (specs/007) is now a third. `auth`
stamps the `audience` claim on every JWT it issues; `estimai-api`,
`notify-api`, AND `refund-api` each verify `audience` against their own
`AUTH_AUDIENCE`. **All four services must carry the byte-for-byte identical
value** (local default: `operai-suite`, see each service's `.env.example`) — a
drifted value fails every request closed (401) in that environment, not open.

**Service clients (ADR-0044, ADR-0048, ADR-0049; specs/016) — one credential per
notify-api caller, no shared secret, no user identity.** `notify-api`'s two internal routes
are `POST /system/emails` (scope `emails.send`) and `POST /system/notifications` (scope
`notifications.push`). Every caller authenticates **as itself** with
`Authorization: Bearer <service JWT>`: a 5-minute RS256 JWT with `sub=system:<client>` and
`aud=SERVICE_AUDIENCE` (never `AUTH_AUDIENCE`), signed by better-auth's rotating key and
verified by `notify-api` through its existing `AUTH_JWKS_URL`. The callers are:

| Caller | `sub` | Scope(s) | Obtains its credential by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `auth` | `system:auth` | `emails.send` | minting it in process (ADR-0048); the client id `auth` is **reserved** — a `SERVICE_CLIENTS` entry named `auth` refuses to start |
| `refund-api` | `system:refund-api` | `notifications.push` + `emails.send` | `auth POST /system/service-token` with `SERVICE_CLIENT_ID` / `SERVICE_CLIENT_SECRET` |
| `estimai-api` | `system:estimai-api` | `notifications.push` + `estimate-notices.send` (crm-api `POST /system/estimate-notices`, ADR-0073; needs `CRM_INTERNAL_URL` on estimai-api and `SERVICE_AUDIENCE` on crm-api) | same |
| `inventory-api` | `system:inventory-api` | `notifications.push` | same |
| `crm-api` | `system:crm-api` | `notifications.push` + `emails.send` + `deal-link-notices.send` (estimai-api `POST /system/deal-link-notices`, specs/024, ADR-0076; needs `ESTIMAI_INTERNAL_URL` on crm-api and `SERVICE_AUDIENCE` on estimai-api) | same |

A person creates, per client, one Railway **Shared Variable** `<NAME>_SERVICE_CLIENT_SECRET`
(32-256 random chars, e.g. `openssl rand -hex 32`, no 1Password item), references it from
that client's `SERVICE_CLIENT_SECRET` (`${{shared.<NAME>_SERVICE_CLIENT_SECRET}}`) and from
its entry in `auth`'s `SERVICE_CLIENTS` JSON (shape in § Notify credential rollout); the
client's `SERVICE_CLIENT_ID` is its literal service name, a key of `SERVICE_CLIENTS`. Each
client holds exactly the scopes it needs (`estimai-api` and `inventory-api` must not hold
`emails.send`); `notify-api` additionally binds each `sub` to the origin app it may push for.
`SERVICE_AUDIENCE` is a Shared Variable required on **both** `auth` and `notify-api`, identical
on the two and different from `AUTH_AUDIENCE`. To **revoke** one caller, remove its entry from
`SERVICE_CLIENTS` (credentials already minted expire within 5 minutes); the others keep
working. To **rotate** one caller's secret, change its shared variable and redeploy `auth` and
that caller (a window of 401s on that caller's pushes is the cost; the push is best-effort and
never rolls back the originating action). A leaked secret lets its holder send what its scopes
allow (for `refund-api`, email over wellD's Resend domain — plan.md Risk R2) until its entry is
removed; it is never logged. The previous shared token was retired by specs/016: § Notify
credential rollout below is the history of that migration.

**Resend domain setup (plan.md Risk R5, ADR-0011 compliance notes).** Before
setting `EMAIL_ENABLED=true` in production:
1. Add `operai.welld.io` (or the chosen sending subdomain) as a verified
   domain in the Resend dashboard.
2. Add the SPF and DKIM DNS records Resend provides to that domain's DNS zone;
   wait for Resend to report the domain "Verified" — an unverified domain
   means invite emails are likely to land in spam or be rejected outright.
3. Prefer Resend's **EU sending region** where available (data residency —
   CLAUDE.md; this is the transactional MTA hop, not data-at-rest, but keep
   the suite's EU-only posture consistent).
4. Set `RESEND_FROM` to an address on that verified domain (e.g.
   `no-reply@operai.welld.io`) and `RESEND_API_KEY` from the Resend dashboard
   (1Password-sourced, never committed).
Until this is done, keep `EMAIL_ENABLED=false` — the email channel stubs the
send and records an `EmailDelivery` row without calling Resend, so the rest of
the invitation flow (create/resend/revoke, admin-ui) is fully testable without
a verified domain.

**Run it:**
```bash
export RAILWAY_PROJECT_ID=...        # from 1Password
export BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL=you@welld.ch
export AUTH_AUDIENCE=operai-suite    # ADR-0010 — identical across auth + estimai-api + notify-api + refund-api
export AUTH_PUBLIC_URL=https://auth.operai.welld.io   # after the auth domain exists
direnv exec auth ./infra/deploy.sh
```

`deploy.sh` as of T19 does NOT yet set `refund-api`'s `REFUND_S3_*` vars (no
bucket provisioned — see § Variable reference); set those manually via
`railway variables --service refund-api --set "REFUND_S3_...=..."` once a real
EU bucket + credentials exist.

**Do NOT set** `ENABLE_TEST_AUTH` (a complete auth bypass — the `POST
/test-auth/session` mint endpoint), `BETTER_AUTH_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` (bypasses the
validated `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` allowlist), or `PORT` (Railway injects it).

**Migrations + seed run automatically** — each service's `preDeploy` in
`.railway/railway.ts` runs before the new deployment starts: `bun run db:release`
for `auth` (migrations + the authz seed), `bun run db:deploy` for every other backend. `migrate deploy` is
non-interactive and only applies pending migrations; the authz seed (idempotent)
creates the system roles + app-access catalog and, on first sign-in of
`BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL`, the first admin. Never edit an existing migration file.

---

## Phase 2 — Vercel frontends

**Project + domain creation is manual** (Vercel CLI can't create+assign domains
here); env-var sync + redeploy is automatable (`./infra/deploy.sh --vercel`).

1. **Create six projects** (dashboard → New Project → import this repo). For each,
   **Root Directory** = the app dir (`shell` / `estimai-ui` / `refund-ui` /
   `admin-ui` / `notify-ui` / `inventory-ui`), framework **Vite**, default build (`pnpm build` →
   `dist`). Each app ships its own `vercel.json` (SPA rewrites + headers) picked
   up automatically.
2. **Assign domains:**

   | Project | Domain | Notes |
   |---|---|---|
   | `shell` | `operai.welld.io` | **Reassign** from the old `estimai-ui` project — the human entry point |
   | `estimai-ui` | `estimai.operai.welld.io` | remote-only; keeps a redirect for the old URL (below) |
   | `refund-ui` | `refund.operai.welld.io` | remote-only |
   | `admin-ui` | `admin.operai.welld.io` | remote-only (roles & permissions, specs/004) |
   | `notify-ui` | `notify.operai.welld.io` | remote-only (notification center, specs/005) |
   | `inventory-ui` | `inventory.operai.welld.io` | remote-only (hardware inventory, specs/015; exposes `./App`, `./MyDevices`, `./version`) |

3. **Env vars** (Settings → Environment Variables, Production **and** Preview;
   all build-time → **redeploy** after changing). See **§ Variable reference**.
4. **EstimAI old-URL redirect:** `estimai-ui/vercel.json` 302-redirects only
   top-level document nav (`sec-fetch-dest: document`) to `operai.welld.io/estimai`
   — so it never catches the shell's `remoteEntry.js` fetches. Smoke-test on first
   deploy (`check.sh` checks it).
5. **Runtime remote URLs (optional):** the shell bakes `*_REMOTE_URL` at build.
   With stable custom domains you need nothing more. To repoint a remote's origin
   without rebuilding the shell, publish `shell/public/runtime-config.json` (see
   `shell/public/runtime-config.example.json` — includes `admin`) — the shell
   reads it at every page load (`shell/src/lib/runtimeRemotes.ts`). **Note:**
   as of this task (T20), `shell/vite.config.ts` does not yet declare a
   `notify` remote (`NOTIFY_REMOTE_URL`) — that lands with specs/005's T13,
   mirroring `ADMIN_REMOTE_URL` exactly. `notify-ui` is deployable and
   reachable on its own domain today; the shell mounting it at `/notify` is a
   separate, not-yet-merged app-code change, not an infra gap.

**Google Maps API key — provisioning (`admin-ui`, T16, specs/012-employee-address,
ADR-0032) — before setting `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` in the `admin-ui` Vercel
project.** `admin-ui`'s AddressSection calls **Google Places API (New)**
browser-direct from the admin's own browser — never proxied through `auth`
(ADR-0032: routing a third party through the identity service would put
Google's latency/availability on the critical path of every tool in the
suite, since every tool authenticates through `auth`). This is admin-ui's
**first** `VITE_*` var and its **first** third-party credential.

1. **Enable the right APIs** on the wellD Google Cloud project — Cloud
   Console → APIs & Services → Library: enable **"Places API (New)"**
   *specifically* (not the legacy "Places API" — a project with only the old
   one enabled returns `REQUEST_DENIED` for the new endpoints, plan.md R6)
   and **"Maps JavaScript API"**.
2. **Create a browser key** — APIs & Services → Credentials → Create
   Credentials → API key, then edit it: **Application restriction = HTTP
   referrers (web sites).**

   > ⚠️ **The referrer list must contain the SHELL's origins, not
   > admin-ui's.** admin-ui runs as a Module Federation remote *inside the
   > shell's document* (ADR-0006) — the `Referer` header on every Google call
   > from that page is the **top-level** URL, i.e. the shell's, **never**
   > `admin.operai.welld.io`. Listing admin-ui's own origin here fails
   > **100% of requests** — and because AC-3.2 makes the feature degrade
   > silently (no error banner, no blocked save, just an address field that
   > quietly never suggests anything), that failure is **invisible** until
   > someone happens to notice. This is risk **R2** (plan.md/ADR-0032) and
   > the single easiest way to ship this feature broken. Add exactly:
   > - `https://operai.welld.io/*`
   > - `http://localhost:5173/*`
   > - the shell's Vercel preview pattern (confirm the exact wildcard in the
   >   **`shell`** Vercel project's domain settings — Preview URLs are
   >   per-deploy, same caveat as the CSP known-gap in § Phase 3)

3. **API restriction:** "Restrict key" → select **Places API (New)** and
   **Maps JavaScript API** only. Never leave it unrestricted; never reuse the
   existing `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`/`_SECRET` OAuth credentials for this — a
   separate, browser-exposed key with a different threat model entirely.
4. **Shell CSP — update `shell/vercel.json` too.** This is **the classic
   miss for this repo** (see § Phase 3 "Shell CSP" below — it happened on
   2026-07-31 with the receipt-bucket `connect-src` entry, and would recur
   here without this step). `admin-ui` runs Module-Federated *inside the
   shell's own document* (ADR-0006), so the **shell's** CSP governs the page,
   not admin-ui's own `vercel.json` — exactly the same fact step 2's referrer
   box relies on. Add `https://maps.googleapis.com` to `script-src` (the
   `<script>` bootstrap `googlePlaces.ts` injects) and add BOTH
   `https://maps.googleapis.com` and `https://places.googleapis.com` to
   `connect-src` (the Places API (New) SDK's own fetch/XHR calls once
   `google.maps.importLibrary` runs). Without this, the browser blocks the
   bootstrap script outright — and because AC-3.2 makes the feature degrade
   *silently* (a `console.warn`, no error banner), every admin in every CSP-
   enforcing environment permanently falls back to manual entry with nothing
   visibly wrong. It also means step 8's own verification (a
   `places.googleapis.com` request returning 200) can never pass, because the
   request is never made. `infra/check.sh` pins both origins (§ Phase 4) so a
   future CSP edit that drops them fails loudly instead of silently.
5. **Daily quota cap + budget alert (R4).** This key is public by design —
   referrer restrictions are spoofable by a non-browser client presenting a
   forged `Referer` header, so the residual risk is **billing theft, not
   data theft** (the key, API-restricted per step 3, grants nothing but
   address lookups).
   - Cloud Console → APIs & Services → Places API (New) → Quotas: set a hard
     **daily request cap** sized to admin-only traffic (AC-4.2 — a handful of
     wellD staff, not the whole suite).
   - Billing → Budgets & alerts: create a budget alert on the project (or a
     budget scoped to this key's SKU) so a spike pages a human before it
     becomes an invoice surprise.
6. **1Password.** Create a new sibling item next to the existing OAuth
   credential — 1Password → `AIScream / OperAI - Google Maps API Key` — and
   store the key value there. Do **not** reuse the `AIScream / OperAI -
   GOOGLE OAuth` item; unrelated credentials, different restriction models.
7. **Wire it as a build-time frontend var, not a `.envrc`/direnv value.**
   This key is consumed entirely client-side by `admin-ui`'s Vite build
   (`import.meta.env.VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`) — the same shape as every
   other `VITE_*` in this repo, **not** the direnv/1Password-at-runtime
   pattern the backends use (§ Prerequisites step 2). Set
   `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` in the **`admin-ui`** Vercel project's
   Environment Variables (Production **and** Preview), sourced from the
   1Password item above, then **redeploy** (build-time vars need a rebuild —
   § Phase 2 step 3). It goes on no other Vercel project, and never on
   Railway. Deliberately **not** a `shell/session` getter (ADR-0032 Option E)
   — that module is for suite-wide service origins the shell configures for
   every tool; a single remote's own third-party credential doesn't belong
   in a module every remote imports.
8. **Verify.** Load the **deployed shell** (not a local/standalone admin-ui
   dev server — the referrer that matters is the shell's), sign in as an
   admin, open a user's detail page, focus the Street address field, and
   type 3 characters. Open devtools → Network and confirm a
   `places.googleapis.com` request returns **`200`** (and suggestions
   render). A `403`/`REQUEST_DENIED` here almost always means the referrer
   list carries admin-ui's origin instead of the shell's (step 2) — recheck
   the restriction before suspecting the key value. If the request never
   appears in the Network tab at all (not even a blocked/red entry), suspect
   step 4's CSP pins instead — the browser refuses to make the call in the
   first place.

---

## Phase 3 — Cross-wire origins + OAuth

- **`ALLOWED_ORIGINS`** on all backends (`auth`, `estimai-api`,
  `notify-api`, `refund-api`, and `inventory-api` as of specs/015) must be the **shell's** origin
  (`https://operai.welld.io`) — that's what CORS + better-auth
  `trustedOrigins` validate. Only the shell's origin is needed: the remotes
  never call the backends directly (they delegate to `shell/session`, which
  runs under the shell's origin). This includes `notify-api`'s SSE stream
  endpoint — its `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` is pinned to the shell origin
  too (plan.md). Redeploy the affected service after a change.
- **`refund-api.ALLOWED_ORIGINS` gains admin-ui's OWN origin**
  (specs/009-mileage-rate, T8, plan.md Risk R8; **obsolete since 2026-11-13**:
  the screen moved to refund-ui's Settings tab, ADR-0023 amendment, so admin-ui
  no longer calls refund-api and the entry can be dropped) — admin-ui's Mileage
  Rates screen calls `refund-api`'s `/rates` endpoints directly (Bearer-authed,
  cross-origin, via `shell/session`'s `apiFetch`), the plan's chosen wiring
  (admin-ui hosts the screen; `refund-api` stays the sole data/logic owner —
  see ADR-0023). When admin-ui runs COMPOSED inside the shell (the normal
  path in production), the browser Origin is already the SHELL's — already
  covered by the entry above, no change needed there. The NEW origin this
  bullet adds is for admin-ui's OWN origin — its standalone dev server
  (`http://localhost:5177`) and any Vercel Preview deploy of the `admin-ui`
  project (`https://admin-ui-<hash>.vercel.app` — Vercel Preview URLs are
  per-deploy, so exact-match CORS can't pin one in advance; treat Preview
  verification of this specific flow as a manual step, same known gap noted
  for the shell CSP below) — add these to `refund-api`'s `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`
  per environment. Hono CORS layer ONLY; `refund-api` has no better-auth
  `trustedOrigins` to keep in sync (unlike the `auth` service).
- **OAuth redirect URIs** (better-auth mounts at `/auth`):
  - Google Cloud Console → your OAuth client → Authorized redirect URIs:
    `<AUTH_URL>/auth/callback/google`
  - GitHub → Developer settings → OAuth App → Authorization callback URL:
    `<AUTH_URL>/auth/callback/github`
- **Shell CSP** (`shell/vercel.json`, a static header) pins each remote origin +
  the auth/API origins in `script-src`/`connect-src`, and allows Google/GitHub
  avatar hosts in `img-src`. If domains change, edit that file.
  **`connect-src` MUST include the `notify-api` AND `refund-api` origins** —
  `EventSource` (SSE) is governed by `connect-src`, not `script-src`; this is
  the classic miss for a streaming feature (plan.md Risk R6). `notify.operai.
  welld.io` (the remote, in `script-src` **and** `connect-src`) and
  `notify-api.operai.welld.io` (the SSE origin, in `connect-src`) are already
  present in `shell/vercel.json`'s CSP string (specs/005 T19) — `check.sh`
  asserts this pin so a future edit that drops it fails loudly.
  `refund-api.operai.welld.io` was added to `connect-src` (T20,
  specs/007-refund-service) — `refund-api` never streams (no SSE), but it's an
  ordinary fetch target from `refund-ui`'s calls (via `shell/session`'s
  `apiFetch`) and `connect-src` governs `fetch`/`XHR` origins too, not just
  EventSource.
  **`connect-src` must ALSO include the receipt-bucket origin**
  (`https://t3.storageapi.dev`, ADR-0016): receipt uploads POST *directly* to
  the bucket, so that request is subject to the shell's CSP even though no
  Operai service is involved. Missing on 2026-07-31 — uploads stayed broken
  after the bucket's CORS rule was fixed, because CSP blocks the request
  before it ever leaves the page. `img-src` does NOT need the bucket today
  (downloads use `window.open`), but would if inline receipt previews are ever
  added.
  **`script-src` AND `connect-src` must include the two Google origins**
  (`https://maps.googleapis.com`, `https://places.googleapis.com`,
  specs/012-employee-address, ADR-0032 — see § Phase 2 step 4): `admin-ui`
  runs Module-Federated inside the shell's document, so the shell's CSP (not
  admin-ui's own `vercel.json`) governs the `<script>` bootstrap and the
  Places API (New) SDK's fetch/XHR calls. `script-src` needs only
  `maps.googleapis.com` (the bootstrap loader); `connect-src` needs BOTH —
  `maps.googleapis.com` (the SDK's own internal calls) and
  `places.googleapis.com` (autocomplete/place-details lookups). Same failure
  shape as the two entries above: silently missing here means every admin
  permanently falls back to manual address entry with no visible error
  (AC-3.2's mandated silent degradation), and the T16 provisioning runbook's
  own "confirm a 200" verification step can never pass. `check.sh` asserts
  both pins so a future edit that drops either one fails loudly.
  *(Known gap: Vercel Preview deploys get `*.vercel.app` URLs the pinned CSP
  won't match — assign preview subdomains or relax CSP via Edge Middleware;
  not implemented.)*
  **Inventory (specs/015):** `shell/vercel.json` already carries
  `https://inventory.operai.welld.io` in `script-src` and `connect-src` and
  `https://inventory-api.operai.welld.io` in `connect-src`. Those hostnames are an
  assumption until the domains exist: if the real ones differ, edit the file and
  redeploy the shell. The invoice bucket's origin is a separate pin — see § `inventory-api`
  service.

## Phase 4 — Verify

```bash
./infra/check.sh
```
It checks backend `/health` for all FOUR backends (`auth`, `estimai-api`,
`notify-api`, `refund-api`), the **`/auth/jwks`** RS256 key set (the endpoint
every resource server verifies against — **not** `/.well-known/jwks.json`, an
orphaned env-key endpoint), each remote's `remoteEntry.js` + CORS header (five:
`estimai-ui`, `refund-ui`, `admin-ui`, `notify-ui`), the shell CSP pins
(including the `notify-api` SSE `connect-src` pin, R6, the `refund-api`
`connect-src` pin, T20, the receipt-bucket `connect-src` pin, ADR-0016 —
override its default with `REFUND_BUCKET_ORIGIN` — and the Google Maps
`script-src`/`connect-src` pins, ADR-0032/specs/012-employee-address), and
warns if `notify-api`'s health payload doesn't
look JWKS-ready. It also probes both of notify-api's internal routes, `POST
$NOTIFY_API_URL/system/emails` and `/system/notifications` (specs/006, specs/016): a
call with no credential must get 401, and so must one carrying the retired
`X-Internal-Token` header (proves the service-credential gate is deployed and
live and the shared-token path is gone). No credential is read or sent. Then, in a browser at
`https://operai.welld.io/`: hit a guarded route → redirected to
`<AUTH_URL>/sign-in`; sign in with Google + GitHub; the `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL`
account sees the **Admin** tool in the nav; create an estimate + reload
(persists); sign out (session ends suite-wide, no 403); as an admin, send a
test invitation from the **Invitations** page and confirm `EMAIL_ENABLED`'s
posture matches expectation (stubbed `sent` if `false`, an actual Resend send
if `true`).

## Variable reference

### Private networking & shared variables (the Layer-2 contract)

All four backends are services in ONE Railway project/environment, so they talk
to each other over Railway **private networking**. Getting these three buckets
right is what removes the recurring "localhost in prod / missing origin"
401·503·CORS class of bug. **Rule of thumb: a *call* between backends uses
internal DNS; a *claim* or a *browser-facing* URL stays public.**

**① Internal-DNS URLs** — one backend *calling* another. Use the target's
private domain over **plain `http://`** (the private net carries no TLS), on the
target's listen port. Each `src/index.ts` binds to IPv6 `::` when Railway's
`RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN` is present (handled in code) — that's what makes
`*.railway.internal` reachable; without it Bun binds IPv4 `0.0.0.0` and internal
calls silently fail.

> **⚠ A service's private domain is NOT derived from its current name.** Railway
> pins `RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN` when the service is **created** and never moves
> it on a later rename. In this project two of four are already mismatched:
>
> | Service (display name) | Actual `RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN` | Key to use inside `${{…}}` |
> |---|---|---|
> | `auth` | `auth.railway.internal` ✅ | `auth` |
> | `estimai-api` | `estimai-api.railway.internal` ✅ | `estimai-api` |
> | **`notify-api`** | **`operai.railway.internal`** ❌ | **`operai`** |
> | **`refund-api`** | **`operai-b6e4.railway.internal`** ❌ | **`operai-b6e4`** |
>
> So **never write `http://<display-name>.railway.internal`** — it looks
> perfectly correct in the dashboard and resolves to nothing. Use the
> `${{target.RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN}}` reference where it resolves, and the
> literal from the third column where it does not (see immediately below).
>
> **…and for `notify-api` the `${{…}}` reference does not resolve at all —
> verified 2026-08-10.** Both spellings come back as an **empty string**, so the
> value silently collapses:
>
> | Written | Resolves to |
> |---|---|
> | `http://${{notify-api.RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN}}:${{notify-api.PORT}}` | `http://:` |
> | `http://${{operai.RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN}}:8080` | `http://:8080` |
>
> This is NOT a blanket rule about references: `${{Postgres.RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN}}`
> in every service's `DATABASE_URL` and `${{auth.RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN}}` in
> `AUTH_JWKS_URL`/`AUTH_BASE_URL` both resolve correctly today — those services'
> reference keys match their display names, `notify-api`'s does not.
>
> **So: prefer the reference, but VERIFY the resolved value in the Variables tab
> before redeploying.** A value containing `http://:` means the key matched no
> service. When the reference will not resolve — as with `notify-api` — write
> the literal private domain, copied from that service's **Settings → Private
> Networking** panel (shown with a green check and "Ready to talk privately")
> and cross-checked against the third column above; never derive it from the
> display name. Railway pins the private domain at service **creation** and
> never moves it on a rename, so the literal is stable. The failure mode this
> box exists to prevent is a `<display-name>.railway.internal` host that never
> existed — not the literal form itself.
>
> Re-verify after any service is recreated (as opposed to merely renamed). On 2026-07-31
> both `auth` and `refund-api` held a literal
> `http://notify-api.railway.internal:8080`, which silently killed every
> invitation email and every refund decision/paid push for as long as it was
> set (both call sites are best-effort by design — ADR-0011/ADR-0017 — so
> nothing surfaced to users, only `[notify]`/`[notifyEmail] failed to reach
> notify-api` lines in refund-api's logs). `env:doctor --live` now flags a
> hardcoded internal host that doesn't match the target's real private domain.
> Confirm any service's value with:
>
> ```bash
> railway run --service <svc> -- node -e 'console.log(process.env.RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN)'
> ```

| Var | Owner(s) | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `AUTH_JWKS_URL` | estimai-api, notify-api, refund-api, inventory-api | `http://${{auth.RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN}}:${{auth.PORT}}/auth/jwks` |
| `AUTH_BASE_URL` | inventory-api (`GET /authz/resolve`, `POST /authz/users/identities`, `POST /system/service-token`, specs/015); refund-api (the `GET /authz/resolve` call); estimai-api (the `POST /authz/app-access-check` + `POST /authz/users/identities` calls, specs/013-estimate-sharing, ADR-0035/0039) | `http://${{auth.RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN}}:${{auth.PORT}}` |
| `NOTIFY_INTERNAL_URL` | auth, refund-api, estimai-api (specs/013-estimate-sharing, ADR-0040), inventory-api (specs/015, ADR-0044) | `http://operai.railway.internal:8080` |

**Use the Railway reference-variable form above (`${{svc.PORT}}`) — do NOT
hardcode the port.** A service listens on exactly ONE port (its `PORT`), and it
is the SAME for public and private traffic. The literal numbers in
`src/lib/env.ts` (auth 3001, estimai-api 8080, notify-api 8081, refund-api 8082)
are only the **code defaults** that apply when `PORT` is unset — Railway may set
a different value (e.g. notify-api's public domain targets **8080**, so its
`PORT` is 8080, *not* the code default 8081; hardcoding `:8081` internally would
fail to connect). For `${{svc.PORT}}` to resolve, **set `PORT` explicitly as a
variable on each backend** (any consistent value), then reference it everywhere —
the port is then unambiguous and can never drift from what the service actually
binds.

**② Public — MUST stay the public URL (the trap).** These are identity *claims*
or *browser-facing* URLs, not backend calls — repoint them at internal DNS and
things break silently:

| Var | Owner(s) | Why it stays public |
|---|---|---|
| `AUTH_ISSUER` | estimai-api, notify-api, refund-api, inventory-api | The JWT **`iss` claim**, string-compared at verify time (`jwt.middleware.ts` `issuer: env.AUTH_ISSUER`) — must equal auth's public `BETTER_AUTH_URL`. Internal DNS here → **every token rejected 401**. |
| `UI_HOME_URL` | auth | Browser post-login redirect. |
| `REFUND_APP_BASE_URL` | refund-api | Deep-link base opened in the recipient's browser. |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | all | Browser Origins (the frontends' public URLs). |

**③ Shared variables — define ONCE at the Railway *project* level, reference
with `${{shared.NAME}}`.** These are byte-for-byte identical across services
today, copied by hand — the source of drift (a mismatched `AUTH_AUDIENCE` is a
suite-wide 401):

| Var | Shared by |
|---|---|
| `AUTH_AUDIENCE` | auth + all 4 resource servers (ADR-0010; `inventory-api` is the fourth, specs/015) |
| `SERVICE_AUDIENCE` | auth + notify-api (ADR-0044) — must be byte-identical across the two **and different from `AUTH_AUDIENCE`**; both refuse to start otherwise. `env:doctor` checks both. |
| `<NAME>_SERVICE_CLIENT_SECRET` (`INVENTORY_`, `ESTIMAI_`, `REFUND_`, `ACTIVITIES_`) | the `secret` inside `auth`'s `SERVICE_CLIENTS` entry for that caller AND that caller's own `SERVICE_CLIENT_SECRET` (secret, 32–256 chars; ADR-0044/0049). One per caller; `auth` mints its own credential in process and has none. Set as a Railway Shared Variable directly on the project — there is no 1Password item, so it is never in a template. |
| `AUTH_ISSUER` | all 4 resource servers (same public value) |
| `NOTIFY_INTERNAL_URL` | auth + refund-api + estimai-api — the three services that CALL notify-api |

Set each as a Railway **Shared Variable** once; each service then references
`${{shared.AUTH_AUDIENCE}}` etc. — one place to change, no hand-copying.

> `NOTIFY_INTERNAL_URL` was added to this list on 2026-08-10, after the private-
> domain trap below had silently broken it for the **third** time (auth and
> refund-api on 2026-07-31; estimai-api from the day specs/013 shipped until it
> was noticed in production). It is one value used by three services and there
> is no reason for three independently-editable copies of it. Sharing it means
> the private-domain question is answered **once**, and a future service rename
> is a one-line fix rather than a silent, per-service outage nobody sees.

The per-service tables below reflect these conventions (a URL marked *internal*
follows bucket ①).

### `auth` service (Railway)

| Variable | Value / source | Secret |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | `postgresql://${{Postgres.PGUSER}}:${{Postgres.PGPASSWORD}}@${{Postgres.RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN}}:5432/auth` | yes |
| `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` | 1Password → `Employee / Paperclip - BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` (≥32 chars) | **yes** |
| `BETTER_AUTH_URL` | `<AUTH_URL>` — the JWT `iss`; must equal estimai-api `AUTH_ISSUER` | no |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` / `_SECRET` | 1Password → `AIScream / OperAI - GOOGLE OAuth` | **yes** |
| `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` / `_SECRET` | 1Password → `AIScream / OperAI - GITHUB OAuth` | **yes** |
| `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY` / `JWT_PUBLIC_KEY` | 1Password → `AIScream / OperAI Private Key` (RS256 PEM; `.pem` gitignored) | **yes** |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | `https://operai.welld.io` (shell origin; no wildcard/trailing slash) | no |
| `UI_HOME_URL` | `https://operai.welld.io/` (post-login fallback; origin ∈ ALLOWED_ORIGINS) | no |
| `AUTH_AUDIENCE` | **NEW (ADR-0010).** One suite-wide value (e.g. `operai-suite`), byte-for-byte identical to `estimai-api.AUTH_AUDIENCE` and `notify-api.AUTH_AUDIENCE`. Stamped as the JWT `audience` claim on every token `auth` mints; closes the cross-service token-replay gap now that `notify-api` is a second JWKS resource server. | no |
| `NOTIFY_INTERNAL_URL` | **NEW (specs/006, ADR-0011).** notify-api's Railway **private**-networking address — always write it as `${{shared.NOTIFY_INTERNAL_URL}}` (shared — see ③; its value is the literal `http://operai.railway.internal:8080`), **never** a hand-typed `notify-api.railway.internal` (that host does not exist — see the ⚠ box in § Cross-service wiring), and **not** `<NOTIFY_API_URL>` (the public domain). Base URL for the `POST /system/emails` call (`src/lib/notify.ts`). | no |
| `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL` | email of the first admin (specs/004 AC-6.1; gets `admin` on first sign-in). Set on Railway, not committed. | no |
| `APP_ACCESS_CHECK_FLOOR_MS` / `APP_ACCESS_CHECK_RATE_LIMIT` / `APP_ACCESS_CHECK_RATE_WINDOW_MS` | **NEW (specs/013-estimate-sharing, T1/T2).** In-process anti-enumeration floor + rate limit for `POST /authz/app-access-check` (ADR-0035). Optional — code defaults `150`/`40`/`600000` apply if unset; set explicitly only to tune per environment. | no |
| `IDENTITIES_RATE_LIMIT` / `IDENTITIES_RATE_WINDOW_MS` | **NEW (specs/013-estimate-sharing, T27).** In-process rate limit for `POST /authz/users/identities` (reuses the same `rateLimiter.ts` module as the pair above, a second instance keyed separately). Optional — code defaults `120`/`600000` apply if unset. No response-time floor needed (ADR-0039 — this endpoint leaks no existence signal the caller doesn't already hold). | no |
| `SERVICE_AUDIENCE` | **ADR-0044, required since specs/016 (ADR-0048).** The `aud` stamped on scoped service JWTs, including `auth`'s own in-process credential for `POST /system/emails`: `${{shared.SERVICE_AUDIENCE}}`, byte-identical to `notify-api`'s and **different from `AUTH_AUDIENCE`** (startup exits otherwise). Startup also exits if it is absent. | no |
| `SERVICE_CLIENTS` | **ADR-0044/0049.** JSON object keyed by client id, one entry per caller that asks `POST /system/service-token` (`inventory-api`, `estimai-api`, `refund-api`): `{"inventory-api":{"secret":"${{shared.INVENTORY_SERVICE_CLIENT_SECRET}}","scope":"notifications.push"},…}` — full shape in § Notify credential rollout. Secret 32–256 chars; scopes are `notifications.push` and/or `emails.send`, each client only what it needs; client id is lower-case alphanumerics and single hyphens, and `auth` is reserved (ADR-0048). Never logged; a parse failure names the rule, never a value. Revoking a client = removing its entry (tokens already minted expire within 5 minutes). Verify the shared references resolved inside the JSON in the Variables tab. | **yes** |
| `SERVICE_TOKEN_SERVICE_LIMIT` | **NEW (specs/029 US-7, ADR-0086).** Service tokens `POST /system/service-token` mints per calling service (the verified `system:<clientId>`) per window. Positive integer, optional, default `300` (steady state is about 3 per service per window). | no |
| `USERS_CONTACT_SERVICE_LIMIT` | **NEW (specs/029 US-7, ADR-0086).** Contact lookups `POST /system/users/contact` answers per calling service per window. Only `system:notify-api` holds `users.contact`. Positive integer, optional, default `600`. | no |
| `SYSTEM_INVALID_CREDENTIAL_LIMIT` | **NEW (specs/029 US-7, ADR-0086).** Requests with an INVALID credential per source address per window, one count shared by both routes. Positive integer, optional, default `20`. It never touches a valid credential. | no |
| `SYSTEM_RATE_WINDOW_MS` | **NEW (specs/029 US-7, ADR-0086).** The one window of the three limits above and the value of `Retry-After` (in seconds) on their single 429. Integer >= 1000, optional, default `600000`. | no |
| `SERVICE_TOKEN_RATE_LIMIT` / `SERVICE_TOKEN_RATE_WINDOW_MS` | **RETIRED (specs/029 US-7).** The old per-address limit (20 per 600000 ms) shared by the whole suite. Now ignored: `auth` starts, never reads the values and logs one warning naming them; env-doctor flags them on `auth` (`FORBIDDEN_VARS`). **Delete them from Railway once the new `auth` is live** (Step 0 command), and from the local direnv / 1Password source. Do not "reuse" them: an override sized for the old rule would no longer mean anything. | no |
| `DIRECTORY_RATE_LIMIT` / `DIRECTORY_RATE_WINDOW_MS` | **NEW (T5, ADR-0047).** In-process limiter on `GET /authz/users/directory`, keyed by caller `sub`. Optional — defaults `60`/`600000`. | no |
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` | no |
| `PORT` | **set explicitly** (any consistent value, e.g. `8080`) so private-networking callers can reference `${{auth.PORT}}` (see § Private networking) — the service binds `env.PORT`, default 3001 if unset, but leaving it unset makes `${{auth.PORT}}` unresolvable | no |
| `ENABLE_TEST_AUTH` / `BETTER_AUTH_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` | **leave UNSET** (see Phase 1) | — |

**`auth` deploy constraint — NEW (specs/013-estimate-sharing, T13, plan.md
Risk R7):** `.railway/railway.ts` pins **one replica** — the
`APP_ACCESS_CHECK_*`/`IDENTITIES_RATE_*` limiters above are in-process
`Map`-based sliding windows, correct for exactly one running instance (same
shape as `notify-api`'s existing SSE constraint, § Topology above). Do not
enable autoscale/multiple replicas without first moving the limiter behind a
shared store (the module is written behind one interface specifically so
that swap doesn't require a rewrite).

### `estimai-api` service (Railway)

| Variable | Value | 
|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | `…@${{Postgres.RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN}}:5432/estimai` |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | `https://operai.welld.io` |
| `AUTH_ISSUER` | `<AUTH_URL>` (== auth `BETTER_AUTH_URL`; **public** claim — bucket ②; use `${{shared.AUTH_ISSUER}}`) |
| `AUTH_JWKS_URL` | **internal** (bucket ①): `http://auth.railway.internal:3001/auth/jwks` (**not** the public `<AUTH_URL>`, **not** `/.well-known/jwks.json`) |
| `AUTH_AUDIENCE` | **ADR-0010.** `${{shared.AUTH_AUDIENCE}}` — same value as every service; `jwtVerify` pins `audience`; a token with a missing/wrong `aud` is rejected 401. | no |
| `AUTH_BASE_URL` | **NEW (specs/013-estimate-sharing, T13).** **internal** (bucket ①): `http://${{auth.RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN}}:${{auth.PORT}}` — base for the Bearer-forwarded `POST /authz/app-access-check` (fails CLOSED, ADR-0035) and `POST /authz/users/identities` (fails SOFT, ADR-0039) calls. **Required** — `src/lib/env.ts` `process.exit(1)`s if absent. | no |
| `NOTIFY_INTERNAL_URL` | **NEW (specs/013-estimate-sharing, T13).** **internal** (bucket ①): `${{shared.NOTIFY_INTERNAL_URL}}` (shared — see ③; its value is the literal `http://operai.railway.internal:8080`) — **not** `<NOTIFY_API_URL>`, the public domain. **Required.** | no |
| `SERVICE_CLIENT_ID` | **specs/016 (ADR-0049).** `estimai-api` — must be a key of `auth`'s `SERVICE_CLIENTS` (scope `notifications.push` only). **Required** — `src/lib/env.ts` `process.exit(1)`s if absent. | no |
| `SERVICE_CLIENT_SECRET` | **specs/016 (ADR-0049).** `${{shared.ESTIMAI_SERVICE_CLIENT_SECRET}}` — byte-identical to that entry's `secret`; 32–256 chars. **Required.** Used to ask `auth POST /system/service-token` (via `AUTH_BASE_URL`) for the 5-minute credential presented to `notify-api`. | **yes** |
| `SERVICE_AUDIENCE` | **specs/024 (ADR-0076).** `${{shared.SERVICE_AUDIENCE}}` — the `aud` of the service JWT crm-api posts deal-link notices with; byte-identical to `auth`'s, **different** from `AUTH_AUDIENCE`. Optional in `src/lib/env.ts`: unset, `POST /system/deal-link-notices` refuses every call and the "Deal" badge never changes. | no |
| `SHARE_LOOKUP_FLOOR_MS` / `SHARE_ADD_RATE_LIMIT` / `SHARE_ADD_RATE_WINDOW_MS` | **NEW (specs/013-estimate-sharing, T13).** Anti-enumeration floor (AC-1.2) + rate limit for `POST /estimates/{id}/collaborators`. Optional — code defaults `300`/`20`/`600000` apply if unset. | no |
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` · `MAX_ESTIMATE_BYTES`/`MAX_IMPORT_REQUEST_BYTES` optional (defaults) |

**`estimai-api` deploy constraint — NEW (specs/013-estimate-sharing, T13,
plan.md Risk R7):** `.railway/railway.ts` pins **one replica** — the
`SHARE_ADD_*` rate limiter AND the 60s in-process identity cache
(`src/lib/authClient.ts`) are both per-process state, correct for exactly one
running instance (same shape as `notify-api`'s existing SSE constraint, §
Topology above). A second replica would silently multiply the effective
`SHARE_ADD_RATE_LIMIT` by the replica count and serve a stale cached identity
from whichever replica answers. Do not enable autoscale/multiple replicas
without first moving both behind a shared store.

### `notify-api` service (Railway) — NEW (specs/005-notification-center)

| Variable | Value | Secret |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | `postgresql://${{Postgres.PGUSER}}:${{Postgres.PGPASSWORD}}@${{Postgres.RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN}}:5432/notify` — **its own logical DB, `notify`, not `estimai`** | yes |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | `https://operai.welld.io` (shell origin) — also what the SSE stream's `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` echoes | no |
| `AUTH_JWKS_URL` | **internal** (bucket ①): `http://auth.railway.internal:3001/auth/jwks` (same endpoint every resource server uses — **not** the public `<AUTH_URL>`, **not** `/.well-known/jwks.json`) | no |
| `AUTH_ISSUER` | `<AUTH_URL>` (== auth `BETTER_AUTH_URL`; **public** claim — bucket ②; `${{shared.AUTH_ISSUER}}`) | no |
| `AUTH_AUDIENCE` | **ADR-0010.** `${{shared.AUTH_AUDIENCE}}` — byte-for-byte identical suite-wide; a drifted value here either rejects everything (401) or (worse, if unset elsewhere) allows cross-service token replay. | no |
| `MAX_STREAM_DURATION` | Seconds an SSE connection may stay open before the server forces a reconnect (ADR-0008). Default `1800` (~30 min). | no |
| `EMAIL_ENABLED` | **NEW (specs/006).** `"true"` (exact string, case-insensitive) to make real Resend calls; any other value (including unset) stubs the send and still records an `EmailDelivery` row. Default `false` — safe for first deploys before the Resend domain is verified (see § Resend domain setup). | no |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | **NEW (specs/006).** 1Password → `AIScream / OperAI - Resend API Key`. Required only when `EMAIL_ENABLED=true` (service refuses to start otherwise once enabled). | **yes** |
| `RESEND_FROM` | **NEW (specs/006).** Verified sending address on the SPF/DKIM-configured domain, e.g. `no-reply@operai.welld.io` (Risk R5). Required only when `EMAIL_ENABLED=true`. | no |
| `SERVICE_AUDIENCE` | **ADR-0044, required since specs/016 (ADR-0049).** `${{shared.SERVICE_AUDIENCE}}` — byte-identical to `auth`'s, **different from `AUTH_AUDIENCE`** (startup exits otherwise; it also exits if absent). The `aud` of every credential accepted on `POST /system/notifications` (scope `notifications.push`) and `POST /system/emails` (scope `emails.send`), verified through the existing `AUTH_JWKS_URL`. There is no other credential: the retired `X-Internal-Token` header is refused (401), and a leftover shared-token variable is simply not read. | no |
| `PUSH_ENABLED` | **NEW (specs/029).** Literal `"true"` enables web push; anything else (including unset) is off. Default off. When on, the four email-notice variables below (`APP_BASE_URL`, `AUTH_BASE_URL`, `SERVICE_CLIENT_ID`, `SERVICE_CLIENT_SECRET`) and the three `VAPID_*` are required or the service exits at startup. See § Push notifications. | no |
| `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` | **NEW (specs/029).** Base64url P-256 public key. Required when `PUSH_ENABLED=true`. | no |
| `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY` | **NEW (specs/029).** Base64url P-256 private key; startup checks it derives the public key. Required when `PUSH_ENABLED=true`. 1Password, never in the repo. | **yes** |
| `VAPID_SUBJECT` | **NEW (specs/029).** `mailto:` or `https:` contact the push services may use. Required when `PUSH_ENABLED=true`. | no |
| `PUSH_EXCLUDED_ORIGINS` | **NEW (specs/029).** Optional CSV of origin apps (`OriginAppSchema` values) whose notifications are never pushed. Default empty. | no |
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` | no |

**`notify-api` deploy constraints (do not relax without reading plan.md Risk
R2):** `.railway/railway.ts` pins **one replica** — the in-process EventBus
fan-out and the in-process stream-ticket store are correct for exactly one
running instance; a second replica silently splits both. Region **must** be
`europe-west4` (data residency — notification title/body may name
clients/estimates) and the service must never log request/response bodies
(reuses `estimai-api`'s method+path+status-only `hono/logger` posture, enforced
in `notify-api/src/index.ts` and called out in `notify-api/Dockerfile`).

### `refund-api` service (Railway) — NEW (specs/007-refund-service, T19)

| Variable | Value | Secret |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | `postgresql://${{Postgres.PGUSER}}:${{Postgres.PGPASSWORD}}@${{Postgres.RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN}}:5432/refund` — **its own logical DB, `refund`** | yes |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | `https://operai.welld.io` (shell origin) **+ admin-ui's own origin** (specs/009-mileage-rate, T8: `https://admin.operai.welld.io` — or its Preview URL, see § Phase 3 — for the `/rates` Mileage Rates screen's direct cross-origin call; composed-shell traffic is already covered by the shell origin alone) | no |
| `AUTH_JWKS_URL` | **internal** (bucket ①): `http://auth.railway.internal:3001/auth/jwks` (same endpoint every resource server uses — **not** the public `<AUTH_URL>`, **not** `/.well-known/jwks.json`) | no |
| `AUTH_ISSUER` | `<AUTH_URL>` (== auth `BETTER_AUTH_URL`; **public** claim — bucket ②, `${{shared.AUTH_ISSUER}}`). Pinned as the JWT `iss` in `jwt.middleware.ts`. NOTE: `refund-api`'s `GET /authz/resolve` call does **not** use this — it uses the separate `AUTH_BASE_URL` below (`resolveClient.ts`). | no |
| `AUTH_BASE_URL` | **internal** (bucket ①): `http://auth.railway.internal:3001` — the base `refund-api`'s `authzMiddleware`/`resolveClient.ts` builds `GET /authz/resolve` against (ADR-0014). A *call*, so internal DNS; distinct from `AUTH_ISSUER`. (This is the var that was `localhost` in prod → 503.) | no |
| `AUTH_AUDIENCE` | **ADR-0010.** `${{shared.AUTH_AUDIENCE}}` — byte-for-byte identical suite-wide; `refund-api` is the THIRD JWKS resource server on this shared value. | no |
| `NOTIFY_INTERNAL_URL` | notify-api's **private**-networking address — always `${{shared.NOTIFY_INTERNAL_URL}}` (shared — see ③; its value is the literal `http://operai.railway.internal:8080`), **never** a hand-typed `notify-api.railway.internal` (see the ⚠ box in § Cross-service wiring) — for the decision→notification push (`POST /system/notifications`, T13, ADR-0017). **Not** `<NOTIFY_API_URL>` (the public domain). | no |
| `SERVICE_CLIENT_ID` | **specs/016 (ADR-0049).** `refund-api` — must be a key of `auth`'s `SERVICE_CLIENTS` with scopes `notifications.push` and `emails.send`. **Required** — `src/lib/env.ts` exits if absent. | no |
| `SERVICE_CLIENT_SECRET` | **specs/016 (ADR-0049).** `${{shared.REFUND_SERVICE_CLIENT_SECRET}}` — byte-identical to that entry's `secret`; 32–256 chars. **Required.** For the decision push (`/system/notifications`) and the batch email (`/system/emails`). | **yes** |
| `REFUND_S3_ENDPOINT` / `REFUND_S3_REGION` / `REFUND_S3_BUCKET` / `REFUND_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `REFUND_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | EU-region S3-compatible object storage for receipt attachments (ADR-0016) — `REFUND_S3_REGION` validated against an EU allowlist at startup once T9 lands. **NOT YET PROVISIONED as of T19** — no bucket exists, no 1Password item exists. See this task's final report / § "Object storage — provisioning" below before T9. | **yes** |
| `REFUND_APP_BASE_URL` | **NEW (T14, specs/008-refund-monthly-processing, ADR-0021).** Absolute base URL of the shell-hosted app — **the shell's own public origin**, e.g. `https://operai.welld.io`, same value as `refund-api.ALLOWED_ORIGINS`/every other backend's shell-origin row — **not** `<REFUND_API_URL>`. Used to build the compiled-batch email's in-app deep link `${REFUND_APP_BASE_URL}/refund/batches/:id`; the email never carries a raw presigned S3 URL. | no |
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` | no |

**`REFUND_ACCOUNTING_DISTRIBUTION_EMAIL` — REMOVED (specs/011-refund-settings,
AC-4.1).** Do **NOT** set this on the `refund-api` Railway service — the
running service does not read, require, or validate it at all anymore. The
accounting-distribution-email is now an admin-managed, append-only
`refund_setting` row (ADR-0027/0029), viewable/editable in Admin > Refund
(`settings:read`/`settings:manage`). See the cutover runbook immediately
below for moving the currently-deployed value across.

**`refund-api` deploy notes:** declared at one replica in `.railway/railway.ts`
like every service, but with no correctness reason to stay there (unlike
`notify-api`) — its `authzMiddleware` in-process cache (T6, ADR-0014) is a
per-replica performance optimization with a 30s TTL backstop, not a
correctness-dependent shared store, so raising its replicas in the file is fine. Region **must** be
`europe-west4` (data residency — financial figures + receipt-attachment
metadata that may carry PII, ADR-0016) and the service must never log
request/response bodies (same `hono/logger` posture as every other backend,
enforced in `refund-api/src/index.ts`, called out in `refund-api/Dockerfile`).

**Cutover — accounting-distribution-email setting (T5, specs/011-refund-settings,
D7).** A one-time, OPERATOR-RUN step, run **once**, immediately after this
deploy lands (the migration that creates `refund_setting` — T2 — must already
be applied). It is deliberately **not** a schema migration carrying the value
and **not** a server startup env read (AC-4.1 stays strictly honored — the
*running* `refund-api` process never touches
`REFUND_ACCOUNTING_DISTRIBUTION_EMAIL`) — it is an idempotent maintenance
script an operator invokes explicitly, passing the value themselves:

```bash
cd refund-api
DATABASE_URL=<refund-api's production DATABASE_URL> \
  bun run settings:seed <the value currently deployed as REFUND_ACCOUNTING_DISTRIBUTION_EMAIL>
```

1. **Before removing the env var from Railway**, read the current
   `REFUND_ACCOUNTING_DISTRIBUTION_EMAIL` value off the `refund-api` service
   (Railway dashboard → Variables).
2. Run the command above against **production's** `DATABASE_URL` (the `refund`
   database), passing that value. The script (`refund-api/scripts/seed-setting.ts`)
   appends ONE `refund_setting` row for key `accounting-distribution-email`
   **only if the key has no rows yet** — `createdByUserId:"system:settings-cutover"`,
   `createdByEmail:"system-cutover@welld.ch"` (a documented, honest first audit
   row — never attributed to a real admin who didn't actually make the
   change). A second run (accidental re-run, redeploy, CI retry) is a
   guaranteed no-op — it never appends a duplicate or overwrites anything
   (the table is append-only at the DB level, ADR-0027).
3. Verify: `GET /settings/accounting-distribution-email` (as an admin/
   `refund-admin`, via Admin > Refund or the API directly) shows
   `configured:true` with the expected value and `updatedByEmail:"system-cutover@welld.ch"`.
4. **Only after verifying step 3**, remove `REFUND_ACCOUNTING_DISTRIBUTION_EMAIL`
   from the `refund-api` Railway service's variables (it is already unused by
   the running code — this step is housekeeping, not a functional dependency).

There is no cron/scheduled version of this script and none should ever be
added (ADR-0013 posture, mirrors the mileage-rate/settings "derived-on-read,
never scheduled" lineage) — it is a single deliberate command run by a human
at cutover time, never a recurring job.

**Object storage — provisioning (DONE).** ADR-0016 named AWS S3 `eu-south-1`
(Milan) or Scaleway `fr-par` as primary candidates, leaving "the exact vendor
an implementation-time choice within this allowlist." What was actually
provisioned is a **Railway S3-compatible bucket** — a custom, non-AWS endpoint
(`t3.storageapi.dev`), which is why `src/lib/s3Residency.ts` is endpoint-aware
and `REFUND_S3_EU_ENDPOINT_HOSTS` exists at all. The five `REFUND_S3_*` vars
are set directly on the `refund-api` Railway service (they are NOT in
`deploy.sh` and were long absent from
`tools/env-doctor/templates/production/refund-api.env`).

> **Residency caveat — verify, don't assume.** `t3.storageapi.dev` is a
> generic multi-region Railway storage host; allowlisting that suffix in
> `REFUND_S3_EU_ENDPOINT_HOSTS` does **not** by itself prove the bucket sits
> in the EU — the startup guard checks the *endpoint host*, not the geography.
> `REFUND_S3_REGION` is `ams`, which reads as Amsterdam and is consistent with
> ADR-0016, but it is a vendor string this repo cannot verify. Given data
> residency is a hard requirement (CLAUDE.md § Data residency), confirm the
> bucket's region once in the Railway dashboard and treat that as the record.

Current production values (the two credential vars are secrets, held only on
the Railway service — there is still no 1Password item for them):

| Var | Value |
|---|---|
| `REFUND_S3_ENDPOINT` | `https://t3.storageapi.dev` |
| `REFUND_S3_REGION` | `ams` |
| `REFUND_S3_BUCKET` | `refund-receipt-g0jy7xar4e` |
| `REFUND_S3_EU_ENDPOINT_HOSTS` | `t3.storageapi.dev` |
| `REFUND_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `REFUND_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | secret |

**Receipt bucket CORS — MANDATORY, and easy to miss.** The browser uploads
receipts **directly to the bucket**, never through refund-api (ADR-0016):
`refund-ui/src/lib/attachmentsApi.ts`'s `uploadToPresignedPost` issues a
cross-origin `POST` from the shell origin straight to the presigned URL. The
bucket must therefore carry a CORS rule naming that origin, or the browser
blocks the upload and the user sees only "Upload failed". This bit us in
production on 2026-07-31: the bucket had **no** CORS configuration at all, and
nothing in this repo had ever set one.

Downloads are NOT affected and do not need a rule — `AttachmentDownloadLink`
uses `window.open`, a top-level navigation, which CORS does not govern. `GET`
is included below only to keep a future fetch-based preview from breaking.

Apply with any S3 client pointed at `REFUND_S3_ENDPOINT` (`PutBucketCors`):

```json
[
  {
    "AllowedOrigins": ["https://operai.welld.io"],
    "AllowedMethods": ["POST", "GET"],
    "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
    "ExposeHeaders": ["ETag", "Location"],
    "MaxAgeSeconds": 3000
  }
]
```

> **The upload passes THREE independent gates — all must be right, and all
> three fail identically ("Upload failed") from the user's side:**
> 1. the shell CSP's `connect-src` must list the bucket origin (§ Phase 3);
> 2. the bucket must carry the CORS rule below;
> 3. refund-api's presigned POST policy must accept the file (size ≤10 MiB,
>    `Content-Type` in `pdf`/`jpeg`/`png` — `src/lib/storage.ts`).
>
> Note that the compiled-batch PDF is NOT a counter-example when uploads are
> broken: refund-api writes it server-side with `PutObject` (ADR-0019), so it
> passes none of these gates. A working batch PDF tells you the credentials
> and endpoint are fine — nothing more.

Only the **shell** origin belongs here: `refund-ui` is a federated remote
reached through the shell (ADR-0006), so the browser `Origin` on the upload is
always the shell's — this is deliberately narrower than refund-api's own
`ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (which carried admin-ui for the `/rates` + `/settings`
calls until they moved to refund-ui, ADR-0023 amendment). Add a `http://localhost:5173` entry ONLY to a
non-production bucket; `refund-api/.env.example` points local dev at the real
bucket, so uploads will not work locally until you do.

### `inventory-api` service (Railway) — NEW (specs/015-hardware-inventory)

Authoritative list: `inventory-api/src/lib/env.ts` (validated at startup, exits 1 on
any miss). Committed contract: `tools/env-doctor/templates/production/inventory-api.env`.

| Variable | Value | Secret |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | `postgresql://${{Postgres.PGUSER}}:${{Postgres.PGPASSWORD}}@${{Postgres.RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN}}:5432/inventory` — **its own logical DB, `inventory`** (create it before the first deploy; its `preDeploy` in `.railway/railway.ts` runs `bun run db:deploy`) | yes |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | `https://operai.welld.io` (shell origin only; a `*` fails startup). inventory-ui is a federated remote, so the browser Origin is always the shell's. | no |
| `AUTH_JWKS_URL` | **internal** (bucket ①): `http://${{auth.RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN}}:${{auth.PORT}}/auth/jwks` | no |
| `AUTH_ISSUER` | `<AUTH_URL>` — **public** claim, bucket ② (`${{shared.AUTH_ISSUER}}`) | no |
| `AUTH_AUDIENCE` | `${{shared.AUTH_AUDIENCE}}` — the fourth resource server on this value (ADR-0010) | no |
| `AUTH_BASE_URL` | **internal** (bucket ①): `http://${{auth.RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN}}:${{auth.PORT}}` — base for `GET /authz/resolve` (ADR-0014; fails **closed**, 503), `POST /authz/users/identities` (ADR-0039; fails soft) and `POST /system/service-token` (ADR-0044) | no |
| `NOTIFY_INTERNAL_URL` | **internal**: `${{shared.NOTIFY_INTERNAL_URL}}` (literal `http://operai.railway.internal:8080`) — never the public domain, never a hand-typed `notify-api.railway.internal` | no |
| `SERVICE_CLIENT_ID` | `inventory-api` — must be a key of `auth`'s `SERVICE_CLIENTS` | no |
| `SERVICE_CLIENT_SECRET` | `${{shared.INVENTORY_SERVICE_CLIENT_SECRET}}` — byte-identical to that entry's `secret`; at least 32 chars | **yes** |
| `INVENTORY_S3_ENDPOINT` / `_REGION` / `_BUCKET` | the invoice bucket — its **own** bucket and credentials, never refund-api's. The bucket MUST be private (every read is a ~60 s presigned GET minted after the entity-scope check). | no |
| `INVENTORY_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `INVENTORY_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | credentials of that bucket, set directly on the Railway service (no 1Password item) | **yes** |
| `INVENTORY_S3_EU_ENDPOINT_HOSTS` | comma-separated EU endpoint host suffixes. Consulted only for a non-AWS endpoint, where the region string is an opaque placeholder; **empty, unset or non-matching on a non-AWS endpoint exits 1**. An AWS endpoint instead requires an EU `INVENTORY_S3_REGION`. | no |
| `PORT` | `8083` — set explicitly so `${{inventory-api.PORT}}` resolves, and make the public domain target this port | no |
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` | no |

**Deploy notes.** Declared at one replica, with no correctness reason to stay there:
authorization results are cached per replica with a short TTL backstop and the
service-token cache is per-process; neither is a correctness-dependent shared store. `.railway/railway.ts` pins region `europe-west4-drams3a`. The
service handles financial figures and personal data (who holds which device), so it
must never log request/response bodies (method + path + status only,
`inventory-api/src/lib/logger.ts`).

**Invoice bucket CORS and CSP — MANDATORY.** Like receipts (§ `refund-api` above), the
browser uploads invoices **directly to the bucket** from the shell origin (presigned
POST; `pdf`/`jpeg`/`png`, size capped by the policy). The bucket needs a CORS rule
naming `https://operai.welld.io` (`POST`, `GET`; expose `ETag` and `Location`), AND the
shell CSP `connect-src` must list the bucket's origin. `shell/vercel.json` currently
lists `https://t3.storageapi.dev` (the refund bucket's host), which covers an inventory
bucket only if it is served from the same host and addressing style. **If the
inventory bucket's origin differs (virtual-hosted style, another host, or another
provider), add it to `connect-src` and redeploy the shell**, or every invoice upload
fails in the browser with no server-side trace. All three gates (CSP, bucket CORS,
presigned-POST policy) fail identically as "upload failed".

**Local dev.** `compose.yaml` creates the dev buckets in MinIO (`:9000`);
`inventory-api/.env.example` documents the local `INVENTORY_S3_*` values.

#### Rollout checklist

`infra/deploy.sh` automates the Railway variables that need no secret and no
provisioned resource (`inventory-api`: `DATABASE_URL`, `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, `AUTH_ISSUER`,
`AUTH_JWKS_URL`, `AUTH_BASE_URL`, `AUTH_AUDIENCE`, `NOTIFY_INTERNAL_URL`, `SERVICE_CLIENT_ID`,
`PORT`, `NODE_ENV`; and, when exported, `SERVICE_AUDIENCE` on `auth` + `notify-api`), creates
the `inventory` logical database, and — with `--vercel` — syncs the shell's
`INVENTORY_REMOTE_URL` / `VITE_INVENTORY_API_URL` and `inventory-ui`'s `SHELL_REMOTE_URL`.
It does **not** set `INVENTORY_S3_*`, `SERVICE_CLIENT_SECRET` or `auth`'s `SERVICE_CLIENTS`
(steps 2-4 below stay manual), and skips the `inventory-api` deploy trigger with a warning
(names only) until those exist. For `refund-api` and `estimai-api` it likewise sets
`SERVICE_CLIENT_ID` but checks by name that `SERVICE_CLIENT_SECRET` exists and skips their
deploy trigger until it does; it warns when `auth` has no `SERVICE_CLIENTS`.
`infra/check.sh` asserts the service, the remote, the shell CSP pins, the service-token
endpoint and the gated-route 401 once DNS exists (its default hostnames are assumptions).

1. **Order matters: `auth` and `notify-api` first, `inventory-api` last.** Deploying
   `inventory-api` before `auth` has `SERVICE_CLIENTS` makes every push a silent 401
   (the push is best-effort and never rolls back a mutation); deploying `auth` with
   `SERVICE_CLIENTS` but no `SERVICE_AUDIENCE` exits at startup.
2. Generate the client secret (at least 32 random characters) and add the Railway
   **Shared Variables** `SERVICE_AUDIENCE` (a value different from `AUTH_AUDIENCE`)
   and `INVENTORY_SERVICE_CLIENT_SECRET`. Never paste either into the repo or a PR.
3. Set on **`auth`**: `SERVICE_AUDIENCE`, `SERVICE_CLIENTS` (JSON above). Set on
   **`notify-api`**: `SERVICE_AUDIENCE`. Redeploy both and confirm they boot.
   `auth`'s `preDeploy` (`db:release`) seeds the `inventory` catalog and the
   `inventory-manager` / `accounting` / `admin` grants.
4. Railway: create the `inventory` database, the `inventory-api` service (root
   `inventory-api`, Dockerfile build, region `europe-west4`), its variables (table
   above), a **custom domain** `inventory-api.operai.welld.io` targeting port `8083`,
   and the private invoice bucket with its CORS rule.
5. Vercel: create the `inventory-ui` project (Root Directory `inventory-ui`, Vite)
   with domain `inventory.operai.welld.io` and `SHELL_REMOTE_URL=https://operai.welld.io/remoteEntry.js`.
   On the **`shell`** project add `INVENTORY_REMOTE_URL=https://inventory.operai.welld.io/remoteEntry.js`
   and `VITE_INVENTORY_API_URL=<INVENTORY_API_URL>` (§ Frontend build-time vars), then
   **redeploy the shell** (both are build-time).
6. DNS for the two new hostnames (`inventory` and `inventory-api` under `operai.welld.io`).
7. Run `mise run env:doctor -- --env production`, and `--live` once the service exists.
8. Assign people to `inventory-manager` / `accounting` in Admin. The two launch
   depreciation rules come with the first migration; **confirm the wellD IT rule
   (spec O1) before the first `welld_it` asset is registered.**
9. Legacy register import — below.

#### Legacy register import (one-off, specs/015 US-12)

`inventory-api/scripts/import-legacy.ts` imports the legacy Excel register for
`welld_ch`. It is a script, not a route. **Dry-run is the default and writes nothing.**

```bash
cd inventory-api
# 1. Dry run: reads the sheet, plans every row, prints counts and row numbers (no row content).
bun scripts/import-legacy.ts --file <register.xlsx> [--user-map <users.json>]

# 2. Apply: ONLY with the opening balance accounting confirmed for 2026, in integer cents.
#    Refused (nothing written) unless the sum of book values at 31.12.2025 equals it exactly.
bun scripts/import-legacy.ts --file <register.xlsx> [--user-map <users.json>] \
  --expected-opening-cents <cents> --apply
```

- `--user-map` is **optional**. It is a JSON file you build by hand from the user directory:
  `[{"id":"<auth user id>","name":"<full name>"}, ...]`; an assignee text becomes the
  holder only if it matches exactly one entry (case, accents and spacing aside).
  Without it no assignee is matched: every asset comes in as stock, flagged "to verify",
  with the sheet's assignee text in its location note, and a manager assigns the holders
  afterwards (each assignment then waits for the employee's confirmation). Because an apply
  cannot be repeated, decide this before `--apply`: holders can only be imported as
  already-confirmed in the one run that carries the map.
- It reads the target database from the environment, as the service does. Run it
  against production only from a trusted workstation, never committing a connection
  string. The workbook is company data and untrusted input: keep it out of the repo.
- The tables it writes (`asset_year_figure`, `fiscal_year`, `asset_event`) are
  **append-only at the database**, so a wrong apply cannot be corrected later. It is
  all-or-nothing in one transaction under the entity lock, a second run on an entity
  that already holds the import writes nothing, and an unreadable row stops the apply.
  Exit codes: `0` done or clean dry run, `1` refused, `2` bad usage.
- The opening-balance figure (spec O3) is an accounting decision. Do not invent it, and
  do not paste it into the repo or a PR.

### `meetings-api` service (Railway) — NEW (specs/021-meetings)

Authoritative list: `meetings-api/src/lib/env.ts` (validated at startup, exits 1 on any miss).
Committed contract: `tools/env-doctor/templates/production/meetings-api.env`. Port **8085**, DB
`meetings`, domain `meetings-api.operai.welld.io`; the remote is `meetings-ui`
(`meetings.operai.welld.io`, local port 5180). **One replica** (declared in `.railway/railway.ts`) — the job runner
(`MEETINGS_WORKER=on`) runs inside the process (ADR-0062).

Everything below is a **checklist for a person**: nothing in this section has been provisioned yet.

| Variable | Value | Secret |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | `…/meetings` — **its own logical DB** | yes |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | `https://operai.welld.io` (shell only; meetings-ui is a federated remote) | no |
| `AUTH_JWKS_URL` / `AUTH_BASE_URL` | internal, `http://${{auth.RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN}}:${{auth.PORT}}…` | no |
| `AUTH_ISSUER` / `AUTH_AUDIENCE` | public claim `${{shared.AUTH_ISSUER}}` / `${{shared.AUTH_AUDIENCE}}` (the sixth resource server on this value) | no |
| `NOTIFY_INTERNAL_URL` | `${{shared.NOTIFY_INTERNAL_URL}}` | no |
| `CRM_API_URL` | internal, `http://${{crm-api.RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN}}:${{crm-api.PORT}}` — the host contract (ADR-0059) | no |
| `SERVICE_CLIENT_ID` / `SERVICE_CLIENT_SECRET` | `meetings-api` / `${{shared.MEETINGS_SERVICE_CLIENT_SECRET}}` (≥ 32 chars, byte-identical to its `SERVICE_CLIENTS` entry) | secret: yes |
| `MEETINGS_S3_ENDPOINT` / `_REGION` / `_EU_ENDPOINT_HOSTS` | the audio bucket; a non-AWS endpoint needs its host in the EU list or the service exits 1 (ADR-0016 lineage) | no |
| `MEETINGS_S3_BUCKET` / `_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | set by reference to the Railway bucket by `provision-tool.sh --bucket`; **its own bucket and credentials**, never crm's or refund's | secrets: yes |
| `MEETINGS_SPEECH_LOCATION` | `eu` — the only value accepted (Chirp 3 is GA in `eu` and `us` only); the Speech endpoint is derived, never configured | no |
| `MEETINGS_VERTEX_LOCATION` | `eu` recommended; `europe-west1` and `europe-west4` are also accepted. `global`, `us` and anything else are refused; the base URL is derived | no |
| `MEETINGS_VERTEX_MODEL_ID` | the pinned Claude model id (`claude-…`); never a Fable or Mythos model. A placeholder until the live eval is green on it | no |
| `MEETINGS_GCP_PROJECT_ID` | the dedicated Google Cloud project (holds Speech, the Vertex enablement and the transient bucket, nothing else) | no |
| `MEETINGS_GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` | the runtime service account's JSON key, **base64-encoded** (1Password `AIScream/OperAI - Meetings GCP SA/key-base64`); its `project_id` must equal `MEETINGS_GCP_PROJECT_ID` | key: yes |
| `MEETINGS_GCS_TRANSIENT_BUCKET` | the transient bucket's name; its location is read at startup | no |
| `MEETINGS_AI_PROVIDER` | `real` — `fake` is refused when `NODE_ENV=production` | no |
| `MEETINGS_TEST_HOSTS` | **must not be set** in production (the service exits 1) | — |
| `PORT` / `NODE_ENV` | `8085` / `production` | no |

**The audio bucket (ADR-0063, AC-4.4) — the service refuses to start without this.** A private
EU bucket, holding audio only (`meetings/<id>/…`), with one bucket-wide lifecycle rule that
expires every object after **29 days**, no prefix filter, versioning **off**, and a CORS rule for
the shell origin (`POST` for the presigned upload, `GET` for playback). `provision-tool.sh`
cannot set the rule, so a person runs `infra/meetings-bucket-policy.sh` once the bucket exists
and **before** the first deploy (needs the AWS CLI and `jq`; credentials come from the
environment only):

```bash
# credentials of THE MEETINGS BUCKET, in the environment of this one command (never on a command line)
export MEETINGS_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=… MEETINGS_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=…   # from the Railway bucket's variables
infra/meetings-bucket-policy.sh --apply --require-cors --endpoint <MEETINGS_S3_ENDPOINT> --bucket <name> --region <MEETINGS_S3_REGION>
infra/meetings-bucket-policy.sh --check --require-cors --endpoint <MEETINGS_S3_ENDPOINT> --bucket <name> --region <MEETINGS_S3_REGION>
```

`--apply` replaces the bucket's lifecycle configuration, so it refuses a bucket that holds
anything outside `meetings/` (a mistyped name would otherwise put a 29-day expiry on offers or
receipts) and a bucket with versioning Enabled (that cannot be switched off). Exit codes: `0` the
policy holds, `1` it does not, `2` usage, `3` could not tell (access denied, unreachable) — **a
check that cannot reach the bucket is never a pass.** Re-run `--check` after any provider change.
Risk R10 is open until this has succeeded on the chosen provider: if it rejects a lifecycle rule
or CORS, stop and pick another EU provider rather than deploying. A `--require-cors` pass only
proves the rule exists; the shell CSP must also list the bucket in `connect-src` (upload) and
`media-src` (playback) — see the note under `inventory-api` above; all three gates fail alike as
"upload failed".

**Google Cloud (ADR-0061 principle, ADR-0069; plan "Amendment 2026-11-05" G-2, G-5, G-6) — verified at
startup, so it must exist before the first deploy.** Transcription is Cloud Speech-to-Text v2 (Chirp 3,
`BatchRecognize`) through a **transient EU bucket**; summaries and Q&A are Claude on Vertex AI in the
`eu` multi-region. Everything the Google APIs let the service read is checked at startup (exit 1,
value-free message); what they do not expose is a **recorded sign-off** (H1-H6 below). Nothing in this
subsection has been provisioned: it is the checklist a person follows, in this order, and the commands
are templates to read first, not a script to paste.

*1. Project and APIs.* One **dedicated** project (nothing else in it: it is the unit of the sign-offs),
in an organization where the policies of step 6 can be set. Enable `speech.googleapis.com`,
`aiplatform.googleapis.com`, `storage.googleapis.com`, `iam.googleapis.com` and, for the eval
identity, `iamcredentials.googleapis.com` and `sts.googleapis.com`. Billing is linked by the
project owner.

*2. Claude in Model Garden.* In the console (Vertex AI → Model Garden) enable the pinned Claude model in
the project. **This accepts Anthropic's Commercial Terms (sign-off H5).** Never enable a Fable or Mythos
model, and never accept the "Advanced AI Safety Addendum" (H3): those models log prompts and responses
for up to 30 days. The model id goes into `MEETINGS_VERTEX_MODEL_ID` **only after the live
prompt-injection eval is green on it** (T103/T104); a model change is a deploy that needs a green eval.

*3. Disable Vertex data caching for the project (check N3).* The setting is project-wide; the service
refuses to start unless it reads `disableCache: true`. Template (confirm the host and shape in Google's
current docs; the T107 spike records which host serves it for `eu`):

```bash
# a person with the permission to update cacheConfig, once. The runtime service account must NOT hold it.
curl -sS -X PATCH -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-access-token)" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  "https://aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/<MEETINGS_GCP_PROJECT_ID>/cacheConfig" \
  -d '{"name":"projects/<MEETINGS_GCP_PROJECT_ID>/cacheConfig","disableCache":true}'
# verify: a GET on the same URL must answer {"disableCache": true}
```

*4. The transient bucket (check N2).* Create it **in the project, in an EU or CH location**
(`EUROPE-WEST4`, Netherlands, next to Railway Amsterdam, is the recommendation; London is refused), then
apply and prove the rules with the script. It never creates the bucket and never changes IAM; it runs as
a person (the runtime account cannot update bucket settings). Needs the `gcloud` CLI and `jq`:

```bash
gcloud storage buckets create gs://<name> --project <MEETINGS_GCP_PROJECT_ID> --location=EUROPE-WEST4 \
  --uniform-bucket-level-access --public-access-prevention --soft-delete-duration=0
infra/meetings-gcs-transient-policy.sh --apply --bucket <name> --project <MEETINGS_GCP_PROJECT_ID>
infra/meetings-gcs-transient-policy.sh --check --bucket <name> --project <MEETINGS_GCP_PROJECT_ID>
bash infra/meetings-gcs-transient-policy.test.sh     # the script's own harness, a fake gcloud: no cloud call
```

The rules (all must hold; exit `0` they do, `1` they do not, `2` usage, `3` could not tell; **a check
that cannot read the bucket is never a pass**): location in the EU multi-region or one EU/CH region;
an enabled `Delete` lifecycle rule on `age` exactly 1 day (0 is refused) as its **only** condition (no prefix or suffix
filter); **soft delete off** (Cloud Storage turns on 7 days for every new bucket, which would leave a
deleted object recoverable for a week); versioning off; no retention policy; no default event-based
hold; uniform bucket-level access on; public access prevention `enforced`. Lifecycle is only a backstop
(it runs late): the service deletes `transcribe/<meetingId>/` itself, at the start and end of every
attempt and before any deletion route changes the database. Re-run `--check` after any change to the
project, and keep the script's location list equal to the service's.

*5. Service accounts, roles and bindings (least privilege; confirm exact permission names with Policy
Troubleshooter, the names below are the intent).*

| Identity | Holds | Never holds |
|---|---|---|
| Runtime `meetings-api@<project>.iam.gserviceaccount.com` (a JSON key, since Railway has no workload OIDC) | a **custom role** on the project: Speech `recognizers.recognize` on `recognizers/_`, `operations.get`, `operations.delete`; Vertex `aiplatform.endpoints.predict` on publisher models, read of `cacheConfig` and of `publisherModelConfig`. **On the bucket only**: `storage.objects.create/get/list/delete` and `storage.buckets.get` | any project-level storage role; `setPublisherModelConfig`; `cacheConfig` update; `aiplatform.consents.update`; `serviceusage`; any IAM permission |
| Speech service agent `service-<project number>@gcp-sa-speech.iam.gserviceaccount.com` (exists once the Speech API is enabled; confirm in the console) | **on the bucket only**: `storage.objects.get` (reads the audio parts) and `storage.objects.create` (writes the result) | everything else |
| Eval `meetings-eval@<project>.iam.gserviceaccount.com` (no key: Workload Identity Federation, step 7) | Vertex predict on the publisher models only | Speech, any bucket, any key |

*6. Key, rotation, expiry and organization policies.*
- **Key (runtime only).** Create it once, straight into 1Password, never into the repo, a terminal log
  or a chat. The base64 text is the variable's value:
  ```bash
  umask 077; f="$(mktemp)"
  gcloud iam service-accounts keys create "$f" --iam-account meetings-api@<project>.iam.gserviceaccount.com
  base64 < "$f" | tr -d '\n'   # -> 1Password "AIScream/OperAI - Meetings GCP SA", field key-base64
  rm -P "$f" 2>/dev/null || shred -u "$f"
  ```
- **Rotation: every 90 days** (a calendar entry owned by the sign-off owner): create a second key, update
  1Password and Railway `MEETINGS_GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY`, redeploy, check the service starts (it exits 1
  on a bad key) and answers its health check, then **delete the old key**
  (`gcloud iam service-accounts keys delete`) and confirm with `keys list` that exactly one user-managed
  key remains. `mise run env:doctor` treats the variable as a secret and never prints it.
- **Escalation trigger:** when Railway ships workload OIDC, move the runtime to Workload Identity
  Federation and delete the key.
- **Organization policies on the project** (defence in depth, the code does not rely on them; set by an
  organization administrator):
  - `constraints/iam.serviceAccountKeyExpiryHours` set to about 2400 h (100 days), so a forgotten key dies;
  - `constraints/iam.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation` **not enforced for this project** (an explicit,
    reviewed exception: the runtime key needs it), enforced everywhere else;
  - `constraints/gcp.resourceLocations` allowing `in:eu-locations` only;
  - `constraints/storage.publicAccessPrevention` and `constraints/storage.uniformBucketLevelAccess` enforced;
  - Google's Vertex AI organization policy that blocks **global-endpoint** usage (confirm the current
    constraint name in Google's docs; the code already refuses `global`).

*7. Live eval identity (GitHub Actions, no key).* A Workload Identity Pool and an OIDC provider for
`https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`, with an **attribute mapping** and an **attribute condition**
pinning this repository, the `main` branch AND the `meetings-eval` environment (all three, never fewer),
bound to the eval service account with
`roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser` on that principal set only. Set the **variables** of the `meetings-eval`
GitHub environment (none is secret): `MEETINGS_EVAL_GCP_WIF_PROVIDER`
(`projects/<number>/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/<pool>/providers/<provider>`),
`MEETINGS_EVAL_GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`, `MEETINGS_EVAL_GCP_PROJECT_ID`, `MEETINGS_EVAL_VERTEX_LOCATION`
(`eu`) and `MEETINGS_EVAL_VERTEX_MODEL_ID`. They replace the previous provider's `MEETINGS_EVAL_*`
secrets and variables: delete those from the repository and from the environment. The workflow is
`.github/workflows/meetings-eval-live.yml` (nightly: skips when unconfigured; on dispatch: fails naming the
missing variables). The evals' content is synthetic.

Attribute mapping (`--attribute-mapping`): `google.subject=assertion.sub`,
`attribute.repository=assertion.repository`, `attribute.ref=assertion.ref`,
`attribute.environment=assertion.environment`. Attribute condition (`--attribute-condition`), with
`<owner>/<repo>` replaced by this repository (preferably also pin `assertion.repository_id`):

```
assertion.repository == '<owner>/<repo>' && assertion.ref == 'refs/heads/main' && assertion.environment == 'meetings-eval'
```

The `meetings-eval` GitHub environment must have **required reviewers** and a **deployment-branch
policy limited to `main`** (settings, done by a person): the condition stops a foreign token, the
environment stops an unreviewed or off-main run of this one. The workflow adds a guard step that fails
unless `github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'` before it authenticates, and installs dependencies BEFORE the
auth step so no dependency script can read the credentials file.

*8. Sign-off checklist (H1-H6): a person records an owner and a date; re-attest quarterly and on any
change to the project. The service cannot read these, so they are not checked at startup.* H4 **blocks
go-live.**

| # | Sign-off | Owner | Date |
|---|---|---|---|
| H1 | **Speech-to-Text data logging is not enrolled** for the project (an opt-in console toggle; the v2 API cannot read it) | ____ | ____ |
| H2 | **Contract:** wellD's use is under the Google Cloud **Master Agreement + CDPA**, not the online Terms of Service (only then is abuse-monitoring prompt logging, up to 90 days for flagged prompts, and human review exempt by default); and written confirmation that it does not apply to Claude on Vertex | ____ | ____ |
| H3 | **No consent to the Advanced AI Safety Addendum** in the project and no Advanced AI model (Fable, Mythos) enabled | ____ | ____ |
| H4 | **Written confirmation from Google on Q1:** with `gcsOutputConfig`, the Speech service keeps no copy of the transcript after the operation, or keeps it for how long (its FAQ says about 5 days for async results). The consent notice discloses the retention (T112). **Blocks go-live** | ____ | ____ |
| H5 | **Anthropic's terms:** enabling Claude in Model Garden accepts Anthropic's Commercial Terms; the data-protection lead confirms this does not make Anthropic a processor of meeting content (Google states prompts and responses are not shared with third parties, partner models included) | ____ | ____ |
| H6 | **Cloud Audit Logs Data Access** for `speech`, `aiplatform` and `storage` do not record request payloads (checked at provisioning) | ____ | ____ |

- The Google DPA and the transfer-impact note (plan O3) are a go-live decision for the data-protection
  lead, not something this checklist closes.

**Wiring in `auth` (do this first).** `SERVICE_CLIENTS` gains exactly:
`"meetings-api":{"secret":"${{shared.MEETINGS_SERVICE_CLIENT_SECRET}}","scope":"notifications.push host-notices.send"}`
(no `emails.send`). Generate the secret (≥ 32 random chars) as the Railway Shared Variable
`MEETINGS_SERVICE_CLIENT_SECRET`. `crm-api` needs `SERVICE_AUDIENCE=${{shared.SERVICE_AUDIENCE}}`
to verify the notices; `env:doctor` fails a template without it.

**Provisioning and order.** From the repo root (plan first, `--apply` only after reading it):

```bash
./infra/provision-tool.sh meetings --port 8085 --bucket           # read-only audit
./infra/provision-tool.sh meetings --port 8085 --bucket --apply   # service, DB, bucket, domains, DNS, Vercel project
# apply the bucket policy (above), set the secrets the script lists, then:
./infra/provision-tool.sh meetings --port 8085 --bucket --connect --redeploy-shell --apply
```

Order: `auth` (scope, client, catalog, default `employee` grant) → `notify-api` → `crm-api` → `meetings-api`
→ `meetings-ui` → shell. A step deployed before the one it depends on degrades silently (a push
that 401s), so check the previous one first. The auth re-seed must be live before anyone opens the tool.

**Shell wiring.** On the `shell` Vercel project set `VITE_MEETINGS_API_URL=<meetings-api public URL>`
(build-time; feeds the trusted-origin allowlist, unset means no Bearer JWT is attached and every
call 401s) and `MEETINGS_REMOTE_URL=https://meetings.operai.welld.io/remoteEntry.js`, then **redeploy
the shell**. `meetings-ui` has `SHELL_REMOTE_URL=https://operai.welld.io/remoteEntry.js` and no
backend variable of its own. To repoint the remote without a rebuild add `"meetings": "…/remoteEntry.js"`
to `shell/public/runtime-config.json`. The shell CSP (`shell/vercel.json`) needs `meetings-api` and
the bucket in `connect-src`, the bucket in `media-src`, and `Permissions-Policy: microphone=(self),
display-capture=(self), camera=()`.

**Local dev.** `docker compose up -d minio minio-createbucket` creates the private `meetings` bucket with
the 29-day rule and no versioning (re-runs replace the rule, never duplicate it). Verify it with the
default MinIO dev credentials:

```bash
MEETINGS_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=minioadmin MEETINGS_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=minioadmin \
  infra/meetings-bucket-policy.sh --check --endpoint http://localhost:9000 --bucket meetings --path-style
```

MinIO has no bucket-level CORS (that step prints `SKIP`; only `--require-cors` makes it fail), and dev
runs `MEETINGS_AI_PROVIDER=fake` until the real Google configuration exists (the fake never touches the transient bucket).

### `activities-api` service (Railway) — NEW (specs/028-activities)

Authoritative list: `activities-api/src/lib/env.ts` (validated at startup, exits 1 on any miss).
Committed contract: `tools/env-doctor/templates/production/activities-api.env`. Port **8087**, DB
`activities`, domain `activities-api.operai.welld.io`. **Backend-only**: there is no `activities-ui`;
the CRM and Projects remotes call it from the shell's origin. It owns no permission catalog (every
access decision is asked of crm-api / projects-api as the caller, ADR-0081). Since ADR-0089 it owns
one private EU bucket, `activities`, for task images and attachments.

| Variable | Value | Secret |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | `…/activities` — **its own logical DB** | yes |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | `https://operai.welld.io` (shell only) | no |
| `AUTH_JWKS_URL` / `AUTH_BASE_URL` | internal, `http://${{auth.RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN}}:${{auth.PORT}}…` | no |
| `AUTH_ISSUER` / `AUTH_AUDIENCE` | public claim `${{shared.AUTH_ISSUER}}` / `${{shared.AUTH_AUDIENCE}}` | no |
| `CRM_API_URL` / `PROJECTS_API_URL` | internal, `http://${{crm-api.RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN}}:${{crm-api.PORT}}` / the same for `projects-api` — the hosts it asks (ADR-0081). Unset, the service exits 1 | no |
| `NOTIFY_INTERNAL_URL` | `${{shared.NOTIFY_INTERNAL_URL}}` | no |
| `SERVICE_CLIENT_ID` / `SERVICE_CLIENT_SECRET` | `activities-api` / `${{shared.ACTIVITIES_SERVICE_CLIENT_SECRET}}` (≥ 32 chars, byte-identical to its `SERVICE_CLIENTS` entry). All three notify variables or none | secret: yes |
| `SERVICE_AUDIENCE` | `${{shared.SERVICE_AUDIENCE}}` — what crm-api's `/system/v1/*` calls are verified against; must differ from `AUTH_AUDIENCE` | no |
| `ACTIVITIES_S3_BUCKET` / `_ENDPOINT` / `_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | **by reference** to the Railway bucket `activities` (ADR-0089): `${{activities.BUCKET}}`, `${{activities.ENDPOINT}}`, `${{activities.ACCESS_KEY_ID}}`, `${{activities.SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}}`. Unset, the file routes answer 503 `storage_unconfigured` and everything else works | keys: yes |
| `ACTIVITIES_S3_REGION` / `ACTIVITIES_S3_EU_ENDPOINT_HOSTS` | `ams` / `t3.storageapi.dev` — the residency check at startup (ADR-0016) | no |
| `ACTIVITIES_MAINTENANCE` | `false` in steady state. `true` makes every route except `GET /health` answer 503 `maintenance` (the migration window below). Any other value stops the start | no |
| `PORT` / `NODE_ENV` | `8087` / `production` | no |

**Wiring in `auth` (do this first, and only after the new `auth` is live).** `SERVICE_CLIENTS`
gains `"activities-api":{"secret":"${{shared.ACTIVITIES_SERVICE_CLIENT_SECRET}}","scope":"notifications.push emails.send"}`
(both scopes: the task-assigned and task-unblocked notices are email notices, ADR-0056), and
the `crm-api` entry gains `activities.write`. An `auth` that does not know a scope named in
`SERVICE_CLIENTS` refuses to start, which is why the order is: deploy `auth` code, then edit the variable.
Generate the secret (≥ 32 random chars) as the Railway **Shared Variable**
`ACTIVITIES_SERVICE_CLIENT_SECRET`, directly on the project; there is no 1Password item and it is
never written to a template, a command line or a PR. `crm-api` needs
`ACTIVITIES_API_URL=http://${{activities-api.RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN}}:${{activities-api.PORT}}`.
`notify-api` must know the `projects` origin and the binding `system:activities-api` → `crm`, `projects`
(code, not a variable) before the first write, or every push is refused silently.

**Task files bucket (ADR-0089), once.** The bucket is declared in `.railway/railway.ts`
(`bucket("activities", { region: "ams" })`): `railway config plan` shows `+ Create bucket activities`,
`railway config apply` creates it. Then set the four `ACTIVITIES_S3_*` references above on
activities-api, and a CORS rule on the bucket for `https://operai.welld.io` (methods POST, GET;
expose `ETag`, `Location`), the same as the CRM's: the browser uploads straight to it. Test one
picture and one attachment on a task. The shell's CSP already allows `img-src https://t3.storageapi.dev blob:`.

**Provisioning.** The service, its logical database, both hostnames and the DNS record come from
the `provision-tool` skill (`.claude/skills/provision-tool/SKILL.md`), backend only:

```bash
./infra/provision-tool.sh activities --port 8087 --no-ui           # read-only audit
./infra/provision-tool.sh activities --port 8087 --no-ui --apply   # service, DB, domain, DNS
# set the secrets it lists (DATABASE_URL by reference, SERVICE_CLIENT_SECRET shared), and
# ACTIVITIES_MAINTENANCE=true BEFORE the first deploy (see § Activities migration)
./infra/provision-tool.sh activities --port 8087 --no-ui --connect --apply
```

The script's shell wiring runs only for a tool with a UI, so set `VITE_ACTIVITIES_API_URL`
(`https://activities-api.operai.welld.io`) on the shell's Vercel project by hand and redeploy the
shell (it is read at build time; the CSP `connect-src` in `shell/vercel.json` already names the host).
Do not open or `curl` the new hostname before the DNS record is reported live (30-minute negative cache).

**Verify.** `mise run env:doctor -- --env production` before; `./infra/check.sh` after (it checks
`/health`, the 401 on a gated route and the 401 on `/system/v1/*`; while maintenance is on it reports
those two as a warning, not a pass).

### Provisioning a new tool

`infra/provision-tool.sh <tool>` creates, or audits, everything a tool needs in
production that `infra/deploy.sh` leaves manual: the Railway service and its logical
database on the shared Postgres, an optional EU bucket, both custom domains, their
Cloudflare DNS records, the Vercel project with its first deployment, and the shell's
two build-time variables. It sets no secret and reads none.

```bash
./infra/provision-tool.sh <tool> [--bucket]                  # plan: read-only audit; prints the block to add
# add the printed service block (and bucket) to .railway/railway.ts WITHOUT a source, commit
./infra/provision-tool.sh <tool> [--bucket] --apply          # database, `railway config apply`, variables, DNS
# set the remaining secrets on <tool>-api in Railway (the script lists their names)
# uncomment the block's source: github(...), commit
./infra/provision-tool.sh <tool> [--bucket] --connect --redeploy-shell --apply
./infra/check.sh
```

The Railway service, its bucket and its domain are declared in `.railway/railway.ts`
(§ Railway configuration as code); the script checks the declaration, refuses to
apply an uncommitted file, and applies it with `railway config apply`, which asks for
confirmation. A block that declares a source while the service has none is refused
without `--connect`, because connecting the repo starts the first build.

Without `--apply` nothing is changed. It is safe to re-run: it fills gaps only, never
overwrites a variable and never deletes. Needs the `railway`, `vercel` and `cf`
(Cloudflare) CLIs logged in, plus `jq` and `dig`. Two things it cannot do: set the
bucket's CORS rule, and choose secrets.

Do not open or `curl` a new hostname before the script reports that it resolves: a
lookup made before the DNS record exists is cached as "no such host" for 30 minutes.
The order of operations, the human decisions and the reasons behind them are in
`.claude/skills/provision-tool/SKILL.md`.

Status: the plan mode is verified against `activities` and `meetings` (both report
nothing missing, 2026-11-13). The `--apply` path with IaC has not yet been run on a new
tool — in particular that `railway config apply` creates a service declared without a
source and leaves it unbuilt is Railway's documented behaviour, not yet observed here;
treat its first use as a supervised run.

### Frontend build-time vars (Vercel) — `VITE_*` are client-side; `*_REMOTE_URL` are Vite-config-side

| Project | Variable | Value |
|---|---|---|
| **shell** | `VITE_AUTH_URL` / `VITE_API_URL` | `<AUTH_URL>` / `<API_URL>` |
| | `VITE_NOTIFY_API_URL` | `<NOTIFY_API_URL>` — feeds `shell/session`'s trusted-origin allowlist and `getNotifyBaseUrl()` (the raise-capability, `useUnreadCount` SSE manager); also the origin `notify-ui` itself calls (mirrors `VITE_API_URL`/`VITE_AUTH_URL`) |
| | `VITE_REFUND_API_URL` | **NEW (T20, specs/007-refund-service).** `<REFUND_API_URL>` — feeds `shell/session`'s trusted-origin allowlist ONLY (`getTrustedOrigins()`, `shell/src/lib/session.ts`); `refund-ui` calls refund-api using its OWN copy of this same var (own build, see the `refund-ui` row below) — both copies MUST carry the identical `<REFUND_API_URL>` value or `apiFetch` will not recognize refund-ui's request origin as trusted and every call 401s. |
| | `VITE_ACTIVITIES_API_URL` | **NEW (specs/028).** `https://activities-api.operai.welld.io` — build-time, feeds `shell/session`'s trusted-origin allowlist AND `getActivitiesApiBaseUrl()`, which `crm-ui` and `projects-ui` use for every activity and task call (no `VITE_*` of their own; there is no `activities-ui`). `provision-tool.sh --no-ui` does not set it: set it by hand and redeploy the shell. |
| | `VITE_INVENTORY_API_URL` | **NEW (T41/T43, specs/015).** `<INVENTORY_API_URL>` — build-time, feeds `shell/session`'s trusted-origin allowlist AND `getInventoryApiBaseUrl()`, which `inventory-ui` uses for every inventory-api call (**inventory-ui has no `VITE_INVENTORY_API_URL` of its own** — unlike `refund-ui`, it asks the shell). **Optional by design and unset by default: when unset the inventory origin is NOT trusted, `apiFetch` sends no Bearer JWT there, and every inventory call 401s** — a silent failure, so set it on the shell project and redeploy. Typed in `shell/src/vite-env.d.ts`. |
| | `ESTIMAI_REMOTE_URL` / `REFUND_REMOTE_URL` / `ADMIN_REMOTE_URL` / `NOTIFY_REMOTE_URL` / `INVENTORY_REMOTE_URL` | `https://<estimai/refund/admin/notify/inventory>.operai.welld.io/remoteEntry.js` (the code defaults are the `localhost:517x` dev origins, so an unset value ships a shell pointing at localhost) |
| **estimai-ui** | `VITE_API_URL` | `<API_URL>` — **required**: estimai-ui builds `${VITE_API_URL}/estimates` from its *own* value (must match the shell's) |
| | `VITE_AUTH_URL` / `SHELL_REMOTE_URL` | standalone-only / `https://operai.welld.io/remoteEntry.js` |
| **refund-ui** | `VITE_REFUND_API_URL` | **NEW (T20).** `<REFUND_API_URL>` — **required**: `refund-ui/src/lib/refundApi.ts` builds every refund-api URL from its *own* value (must byte-for-byte match the shell's copy above — see that row's note) |
| | `SHELL_REMOTE_URL` | `https://operai.welld.io/remoteEntry.js` |
| **inventory-ui** | `SHELL_REMOTE_URL` | `https://operai.welld.io/remoteEntry.js` (no backend vars of its own: inventory-api via `getInventoryApiBaseUrl()`, the user directory via `getAuthBaseUrl()`, both from the shell) |
| **admin-ui**, **notify-ui** | `SHELL_REMOTE_URL` | `https://operai.welld.io/remoteEntry.js` (no backend vars of their own — `notify-ui`'s calls to `notify-api` go through the shared `shell/session` module's `VITE_NOTIFY_API_URL`, same pattern `admin-ui` uses for the auth service's admin API) |
| **admin-ui** | `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` | **NEW (T16, specs/012-employee-address, ADR-0032).** Google Places API (New) + Maps JavaScript API browser key, referrer-restricted to the **shell's** origins (not admin-ui's own — see § Phase 2's "Google Maps API key — provisioning"). admin-ui's own third-party credential, deliberately **not** a `shell/session` getter. |

Cross-service wiring: `auth.BETTER_AUTH_URL == estimai-api.AUTH_ISSUER ==
notify-api.AUTH_ISSUER == refund-api.AUTH_ISSUER`; `estimai-api.AUTH_JWKS_URL

`auth.SERVICE_CLIENTS` whose `secret` equals `inventory-api.SERVICE_CLIENT_SECRET` and
whose `scope` contains `notifications.push`; no service holds the retired shared token
(`env:doctor` flags it by name); `inventory-api.INVENTORY_S3_ENDPOINT`'s host is in
`INVENTORY_S3_EU_ENDPOINT_HOSTS` (or an AWS endpoint in an EU region). All except the
bucket's own CORS rule are checked by `mise run env:doctor`
(`tools/env-doctor/README.md`).

## Notify credential rollout (specs/016, ADR-0048/0049)

> **Rollout completed on 2026-10-30.** All three pushes and Manual A/B are done:
> every caller uses its own service credential, `NOTIFY_INTERNAL_TOKEN` is deleted from
> every Railway service and refused by `notify-api`, and env-doctor forbids it. This
> section is kept as the record of how it was done; for the current setup see the
> **Service clients** paragraph above (§ Phase 1 — Railway backends).

Every caller of `notify-api`'s internal routes moves from the shared
`NOTIFY_INTERNAL_TOKEN` to its own scoped service credential, and the shared token is
then deleted. A push to `main` redeploys all five Railway services at once, in no fixed
order, so the safe order is **three pushes with manual steps between them**. Each step
starts only when the previous one is confirmed.

Roles: **P1/P2/P3** are pushes (T6, T13 and T18 in `specs/016-notify-service-credentials/tasks.md`
are done by a person, never by an agent). **Manual A/B** edit Railway variables. No step below
reads or prints a variable value; where a check lists variables it lists **names only**
(`| jq -r 'keys[]'` keeps the values off the terminal).

### Variables (names; nothing here is a value)

| Variable | Where | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `SERVICE_AUDIENCE` | Shared Variable; referenced by `auth` and `notify-api` | The `aud` on service JWTs. **Required in both from push 1**; must differ from `AUTH_AUDIENCE` and be identical on the two. Already set in production since specs/015. |
| `INVENTORY_SERVICE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Shared Variable | Exists. `inventory-api` is unchanged. |
| `ESTIMAI_SERVICE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Shared Variable (**new**, Manual A) | One secret, 32-256 chars. Referenced inside `auth`'s `SERVICE_CLIENTS` and by `estimai-api`'s `SERVICE_CLIENT_SECRET`. |
| `REFUND_SERVICE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Shared Variable (**new**, Manual A) | Same, for `refund-api`. |
| `SERVICE_CLIENTS` | `auth` | JSON of all clients, shape below. |
| `SERVICE_CLIENT_ID` / `SERVICE_CLIENT_SECRET` | `refund-api`, `estimai-api` (**new**, Manual A) | Literal client id (`refund-api` / `estimai-api`) and `${{shared.<NAME>_SERVICE_CLIENT_SECRET}}`. |
| `NOTIFY_INTERNAL_TOKEN` | `notify-api`, `auth`, `refund-api`, `estimai-api` | The shared token. Optional in `notify-api` from push 1; deleted at Manual B; gone from the code at push 3. |

`SERVICE_CLIENTS` on `auth` after Manual A (as in
`tools/env-doctor/templates/production/auth.env`; the secrets are Railway references, never
literals). Each client holds exactly the scopes it needs; `estimai-api` and `inventory-api`
must not hold `emails.send`, and a client id of `auth` is refused at startup (ADR-0048):

```json
{
  "inventory-api": { "secret": "${{shared.INVENTORY_SERVICE_CLIENT_SECRET}}", "scope": "notifications.push" },
  "estimai-api":   { "secret": "${{shared.ESTIMAI_SERVICE_CLIENT_SECRET}}",   "scope": "notifications.push" },
  "refund-api":    { "secret": "${{shared.REFUND_SERVICE_CLIENT_SECRET}}",    "scope": "notifications.push emails.send" }
}
```

(On one line in the Variables tab. After saving, open it and confirm each `${{shared.…}}`
resolved inside the JSON.)

### Step 0 - before push 1: preconditions (names only)

```bash
# SERVICE_AUDIENCE must exist on BOTH auth and notify-api before push 1: both now exit at startup without it.
for s in auth notify-api; do
  printf '%s: ' "$s"
  railway variables --service "$s" --json | jq -r 'keys[]' | grep -qx SERVICE_AUDIENCE && echo present || echo MISSING
done
# Retired names: the old per-address token limit (SERVICE_TOKEN_RATE_*) is ignored since specs/029 US-7.
# Listing one is not a failure; it is a leftover to delete once the new auth is live.
railway variables --service auth --json | jq -r 'keys[]' | grep '^SERVICE_TOKEN_RATE' || echo "none (nothing to delete)"
```

- Anything `MISSING`: stop. Add the `${{shared.SERVICE_AUDIENCE}}` reference first (its value
  must differ from `AUTH_AUDIENCE`), otherwise push 1 stops `auth` or `notify-api` from starting.
- If a `SERVICE_TOKEN_RATE_*` name is listed: since specs/029 US-7 it has no effect (the limit is
  per calling service, `SERVICE_TOKEN_SERVICE_LIMIT` default 300 and `USERS_CONTACT_SERVICE_LIMIT`
  default 600, both per `SYSTEM_RATE_WINDOW_MS`). Do not size it; delete it after the new `auth`
  is live (§ Push notifications -> Rollout order). Only if `SERVICE_TOKEN_SERVICE_LIMIT`,
  `USERS_CONTACT_SERVICE_LIMIT`, `SYSTEM_INVALID_CREDENTIAL_LIMIT` or `SYSTEM_RATE_WINDOW_MS` is
  set, check that the value is not below the default (the same listing with
  `grep -E '^(SERVICE_TOKEN_SERVICE_LIMIT|USERS_CONTACT_SERVICE_LIMIT|SYSTEM_)'`).
- `mise run env:doctor -- --env production` passes on the committed templates.

### Step 1 - Push 1: the new mechanism is accepted, nothing uses it yet

Contains (T1-T5): `auth` (scope `emails.send`, reserved id `auth`, in-process self-mint, not
yet used); `notify-api` (both routes accept a service credential, origin bindings
`system:refund-api -> refund` and `system:estimai-api -> estimai`, the `caller=` log line,
shared token optional); `env-doctor`; this section. Callers are unchanged.

Result: every caller still sends the shared token and it still works. The `notify-api` log now
shows `caller=shared-token` for each of those calls.

### Step 2 - Wait for push 1 to be live, then confirm (R-4)

`auth` on the old code refuses to start on a `SERVICE_CLIENTS` value containing `emails.send`,
so Manual A must not begin until `auth`'s **push-1 deployment is the live one**.

```bash
railway deployment list --service auth        # newest row: status SUCCESS, commit = push 1
railway deployment list --service notify-api  # same
./infra/check.sh                              # all checks pass
mise run env:doctor -- --env production --live
```

Continue only when both services show the push-1 commit as the active, successful deployment
and `env-doctor --live` reports no failure.

### Step 3 - Manual A: create the credentials (a person, in Railway)

1. Create two **Shared Variables** on the project, each at least 32 random characters
   (e.g. `openssl rand -hex 32 | tr -d '\n' | pbcopy`, so the value goes to the clipboard and
   is never echoed, then pasted straight into Railway, never into the repo, a PR, a chat or a
   shell history): `ESTIMAI_SERVICE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `REFUND_SERVICE_CLIENT_SECRET`.
2. On **`auth`**, set `SERVICE_CLIENTS` to the JSON above.
3. On **`refund-api`**: `SERVICE_CLIENT_ID=refund-api`,
   `SERVICE_CLIENT_SECRET=${{shared.REFUND_SERVICE_CLIENT_SECRET}}`.
   On **`estimai-api`**: `SERVICE_CLIENT_ID=estimai-api`,
   `SERVICE_CLIENT_SECRET=${{shared.ESTIMAI_SERVICE_CLIENT_SECRET}}`.
4. Let the redeploys finish. The callers' running code (pre push 2) ignores the new
   variables; `auth` (already on push 1) accepts the new scope. Do **not** touch
   `NOTIFY_INTERNAL_TOKEN`.
5. Verify: `./infra/check.sh` passes; `mise run env:doctor -- --env production --live`
   reports no failure (it checks that each caller's id and secret match its `SERVICE_CLIENTS`
   entry, that each entry holds exactly its scopes, and flags a missing variable by name);
   then trigger one invitation email and one refund decision and confirm both still arrive
   and the log shows `caller=shared-token` for them (step 5 shows the command).

### Step 4 - Push 2: the callers switch

`auth`, `refund-api` and `estimai-api` send their own credential (T7-T12). Wait until the
deployments of all three, and of `notify-api`, are the active successful ones.

If a call fails with HTTP 429 from `auth POST /system/service-token` in a caller log during
this window, do not retry in a loop and do not set `SERVICE_TOKEN_RATE_*` (retired, ignored).
Read `auth`'s log: `allowance exhausted caller=system:<id>` means that service passed its own
`SERVICE_TOKEN_SERVICE_LIMIT` (300 per window by default; raise it for the environment);
`invalid-credential limit reached` means requests with a wrong credential arrived from one
address (fix the caller's secret). The refusal is the same 429 either way, with `Retry-After`
set to the window in seconds.

### Step 5 - Verify with the log line only

Trigger every call site at least once: an invitation email and a resend, a refund approval
and a rejection, a batch email, a collaborator grant and a removal on an estimate, and an
inventory assignment. A call site you skip can still be on the shared token without showing
up here. Then read the caller identity (never a variable):

```bash
railway logs --service notify-api --since 30m \
  | grep -o '\[system-auth\] [A-Z]* [^ ]* caller=[^ ]*' | sort | uniq -c
```

Expect one line per flow, each `caller=system:auth`, `caller=system:refund-api`,
`caller=system:estimai-api` or `caller=system:inventory-api`, and **no
`caller=shared-token` line since push 2 finished deploying**. If the CLI has no `--since`,
use the dashboard log view of `notify-api` filtered by `caller=` and the trigger time.
Any `caller=shared-token` line means a caller is still on the shared token: find it, fix it,
and repeat this step. Do not go on.

### Step 6 - Manual B: delete the shared token (point of no return)

**This is the step after which the shared token stops working.** It is undone by putting the
`NOTIFY_INTERNAL_TOKEN` variable back on `notify-api` and redeploying it (paste the value from
1Password, item `AIScream / OperAI - NOTIFY_INTERNAL_TOKEN`; never echo it), because
`notify-api` still contains the legacy path until push 3.

1. Delete `NOTIFY_INTERNAL_TOKEN` from **`notify-api` only**. Redeploy it.
2. Re-run the step 5 triggers and the same `grep`: every flow still logs `caller=system:*`.
   A flow that stopped delivering is a caller you missed; restore the variable and go back to step 5.
3. Run `./infra/check.sh`: the no-credential 401 checks still pass.
4. Only then delete `NOTIFY_INTERNAL_TOKEN` from `auth`, `refund-api` and `estimai-api`.
5. Verify, by name: `for s in auth notify-api refund-api estimai-api inventory-api; do railway variables --service "$s" --json | jq -r 'keys[]' | grep -x NOTIFY_INTERNAL_TOKEN && echo "$s still has it"; done`
   prints nothing.

### Step 7 - Push 3: the legacy code and the variable leave the repository

`notify-api` drops the legacy path and the variable; `env-doctor` moves
`NOTIFY_INTERNAL_TOKEN` to `FORBIDDEN_VARS` for all five services; `infra/deploy.sh`,
`infra/check.sh`, `shell/playwright.config.ts` and the docs lose every mention (T14-T17). It
must not reach `main` before Manual B is done. Afterwards `X-Internal-Token` with any value is
a 401 on both routes. Retire the 1Password item once nothing reads it.
After the deploy: `./infra/check.sh` passes (both routes answer 401 to no credential and to
an `X-Internal-Token` header) and `mise run env:doctor -- --env production --live` reports no
failure (it flags the retired variable by name on any service).

### Rollback by step

| Failure at | Action |
|---|---|
| Step 1 | Redeploy the previous deployment of `auth` and `notify-api`. No variable changed yet. |
| Step 3 | Remove the new `SERVICE_CLIENT_*` variables and restore the previous `SERVICE_CLIENTS` value (the single `inventory-api` entry). Callers were never using them. |
| Step 4 | Redeploy the previous deployment of the failing caller; the shared token still works at this point. |
| Step 6 | Put `NOTIFY_INTERNAL_TOKEN` back on `notify-api` (pasted from 1Password, never echoed) and redeploy it; the legacy path is still in the code. After 6.4, rolling a caller back below push 2 also needs the variable restored on that caller, because those builds still require it at startup. |
| Step 7 | Revert the push. Push 3 only removes code and docs; if it also has to undo step 6, restore the variable first. |

## EstimAI oversight and deal badge rollout (specs/024, ADR-0075/0076)

Order matters: `auth` refuses to start when `SERVICE_CLIENTS` names a scope it does not know.

1. Deploy `auth` (new `estimate:read-all` catalog action, seeded to `admin`; new scope
   `deal-link-notices.send`). The seed runs at startup.
2. Only after that deploy is live: add `deal-link-notices.send` to the `crm-api` entry of
   `auth`'s `SERVICE_CLIENTS` (template: `tools/env-doctor/templates/production/auth.env`).
3. Set `SERVICE_AUDIENCE=${{shared.SERVICE_AUDIENCE}}` on `estimai-api` and
   `ESTIMAI_INTERNAL_URL=http://${{estimai-api.RAILWAY_PRIVATE_DOMAIN}}:${{estimai-api.PORT}}`
   on `crm-api`, then deploy `estimai-api` (migration `crmDealId`/`crmLinkAt`) and `crm-api`.
4. `mise run env:doctor -- --env production` before, and the shell/estimai-ui deploy after.
5. Backfill the existing links once (dry run first; safe to re-run, it is also the repair for
   a lost notice). It needs crm-api's own variables and reaches estimai-api over private
   networking, so run it INSIDE the crm-api service (e.g. `railway ssh --service crm-api`), not
   from a laptop:

   ```bash
   bun scripts/backfill-estimate-links.ts            # dry run: prints how many would be sent
   bun scripts/backfill-estimate-links.ts --apply
   ```

## Activities migration (specs/028, ADR-0081/0082/0083)

The CRM's activities, participants, "blocked by" links and meeting host state move into the new
`activities-api`. The move is **expand, switch, copy, unpause, contract**, with a short announced
write pause between expand and unpause (accepted by the owner, AC-2.5). Two rules run through all
of it: a record is "moved" only when the **found-versus-present count** says so, never because a
command exited 0; and the CRM tables are **not dropped** until a later push, after the production
report is clean. A push to `main` redeploys every Railway service in no fixed order (ADR-0049), so
the order below is enforced by *what is live when*, not by the push order: wait for each deploy to
be live (and read its log) before the next step.

**Roles.** One person owns the window and is the only one who can end it (`ACTIVITIES_MAINTENANCE`
is a manual variable; a failed copy that is not re-run leaves the pause in place). Announce the
pause to CRM users beforehand: during it nobody can record or change a CRM activity or task, and
the CRM shows "activities unavailable" (AC-1.5).

**Step 0 - preconditions (names only).**
`mise run env:doctor -- --env production` passes; `activities-api` exists on Railway with its own
database (see § `activities-api` service); `ACTIVITIES_SERVICE_CLIENT_SECRET` exists as a Shared
Variable; `ACTIVITIES_MAINTENANCE=true` is already set on `activities-api` **before its first
deploy**; `ACTIVITIES_API_URL` is set on `crm-api`; `VITE_ACTIVITIES_API_URL` is set on the shell's
Vercel project. You hold a connection string for the CRM database for the window of the copy (see
Step 3); the copy writes no file and no dump.

**Step 1 - Expand: the grants, notify, then the new service in maintenance.**
Deploy, in this order, each live before the next:
1. `auth` (new scope `activities.write` among the known scopes). Only then edit `SERVICE_CLIENTS`
   (the `activities-api` entry; `crm-api` gains `activities.write`) and redeploy `auth`; an unknown
   scope stops `auth`.
2. `notify-api` (origin `projects`, binding `system:activities-api` → `crm`, `projects`, email
   footer label). It is additive and harmless with no caller, and it must be live before Step 4,
   the first moment `activities-api` writes and so pushes. Without it every push is refused and the
   refusal is invisible (best effort, the write stands).
3. `activities-api` with `ACTIVITIES_MAINTENANCE=true` (its `preDeploy` applies the
   migration), and `projects-api` with its host endpoint.

Verify (the service is up and refusing):

```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' https://activities-api.operai.welld.io/health   # 200: health stays up
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' https://activities-api.operai.welld.io/tasks    # 503: maintenance, before authentication
```

**Step 2 - Switch: the new code that stops using the old tables.**
Deploy `crm-api` (new code; the old activity tables are still in its database, now read only by
the copy), then `shell`, `crm-ui`, `projects-ui` and `notify-ui` (an older `notify-ui` shows the raw
id `projects` as the origin tag: degraded, never broken). From here the CRM's activity writes go to
`activities-api` and are refused with 503 `maintenance`; its meeting-host notices are forwarded and
refused the same way, so the old `meeting_host_state` is frozen. Nothing writes to either side.

**Step 3 - Copy: dry run, then apply, each accounted for.**
The script is in the `activities-api` image, reaches both databases over private networking, and
prints counts, ids and field names only (never an activity subject, body or address). Run it
**inside** the `activities-api` service so its own `DATABASE_URL` is the target; give it the CRM
database as `CRM_DATABASE_URL` in the environment of that one shell. The script takes both
connection strings from the environment only and rejects `--crm-database-url`/`--database-url`
(a URL on a command line lands in `ps` and the shell history). A source activity that refers to a
contact erased in the target (`erased_contact`) is a `mismatched` row (field `contactId`), never
written:

```bash
railway ssh --service activities-api
# inside; CRM_DATABASE_URL = the crm database on the shared Postgres (private domain), set for this shell only
bun scripts/import-crm-activities.ts            # dry run: reads, writes nothing
bun scripts/import-crm-activities.ts            # again: every `found` must be identical (the source is frozen)
bun scripts/import-crm-activities.ts --apply    # one transaction; it re-reads the target and compares before it commits
bun scripts/import-crm-activities.ts --apply    # a second run: inserted=0 (re-runnable, AC-2.2)
```

Gate for every run: per table (`activity`, `activity_participant`, `task_blocker`,
`meeting_mirror_state`) the report shows `found`, `inserted` (dry run: `to-insert`),
`already-present` and `mismatched`, and ends with `ACCOUNTED FOR`. Exit 0 and that line are the
condition to go on. **`mismatched` above 0, `NOT ACCOUNTED FOR`, or a `found` that changed between
two dry runs stops the window**: nothing is written, the script repairs nothing, the pause stays
and the decision goes back to the owner. If `--apply` fails nothing was committed (it rolls back);
fix the cause and re-run. Keep the final report with the release notes; it is the record that the
move was accounted for. The old tables stay untouched, so until the contract push the undo is
"keep the CRM tables" (see Rollback by step).

**Step 4 - Unpause, then prove notifications reach people.**
Only with a clean report from Step 3: set `ACTIVITIES_MAINTENANCE=false` on `activities-api` and
redeploy it. Then:

1. `./infra/check.sh`: the 401 gates are provable again, so no maintenance warning remains for
   `activities-api`.
2. **Retry the meeting notices that arrived during the pause.** `meetings-api` could not deliver
   them while `activities-api` refused (503). `unlinked`/`deleted` notices retry by themselves
   (1 min, 5 min, 30 min, 2 h, then every 6 h) until delivered; `linked`/`changed` ones are **never**
   retried silently and need their creator to press "Try again" on the meeting (it calls
   `POST /meetings/:id/host-notice/retry`). List what is still undelivered since the window began
   (read only; ids and states only; delivered rows are deleted) and have each creator retry:

   ```sql
   -- on the meetings database, read only
   SELECT "meetingId", "creatorUserId", event, policy, state, attempts, "lastErrorCode", "createdAt"
   FROM host_notice WHERE "hostApp" = 'crm' AND "createdAt" >= '<pause start, ISO 8601>' ORDER BY "createdAt";
   ```

   Done when the query returns no row for the window (re-run it after the creators have retried and
   the automatic ones have had their next attempt).
3. **Assign one test task in each host to a second person** (a CRM task on a company, a task on a
   project) and check that each reaches that person's `/notify` page with the origin "CRM" and
   "Projects" respectively. notify-api's `caller=system:activities-api` log line alone does **not**
   prove it (the middleware logs it before the route's 400/403, and the push is best effort, so a
   refusal is otherwise invisible). Delete the two test tasks afterwards.

**Step 5 - Contract: a LATER push, never with the switch.**
Only after the production report of Step 3 is filed and clean, and the CRM has run on
`activities-api` for a while with nothing amiss, merge the separate crm-api migration (specs/028 T14)
that drops `task_blocker`, `activity_participant`, `activity`, `meeting_host_state` and the
`ActivityType` enum. Its commit says it ships only after the import report. It is **one-way**: take a
database backup first, and never put it in the same push as Step 2 (AC-2.3: nothing leaves the CRM
until the copy is accounted for). Afterwards verify that `crm-api` is healthy and that the CRM's
timeline and tasks still load (they no longer depend on those tables).

### Rollback by step
- Before Step 3 applies: nothing was copied. Redeploy the previous `crm-api`, `crm-ui` and `shell`
  if the CRM must come back; delete nothing.
- After Step 3, before Step 4's unpause: the CRM tables are intact. Keep the pause on, fix the cause
  and re-run the copy; or redeploy the previous `crm-api`/`crm-ui` (the CRM's own tables hold
  everything up to the freeze) and leave `activities-api` in maintenance.
- After the unpause, before Step 5: `activities-api` now holds records the CRM tables do not, so
  going back to the previous `crm-api` loses them. Roll forward (fix and redeploy) instead; the old
  tables are only a fallback for the state at the freeze.
- After Step 5: one-way; restore from the backup taken before it.

## Push notifications (specs/029, ADR-0084/0085)

System notifications on the user's desktop (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari on macOS) through standard
Web Push with encrypted payloads. `notify-api` holds the VAPID pair, stores one row per browser and sends
after it has stored the in-app notification; the shell serves `/push-sw.js` and a "Push notifications"
section in My profile. Everything is off until you turn it on; nothing below is a value.

### Generate the VAPID keys (once per environment)

```bash
bunx web-push generate-vapid-keys --json     # prints {"publicKey": "...", "privateKey": "..."}
```

- One pair **per environment** (production, and any preview/staging that enables push). Never reuse the
  production pair elsewhere.
- Keep the output out of the shell history and the repo: copy it straight into 1Password.
- The public key is not secret (the shell fetches it from `GET /push/config`); the private key is.

### Store the private key in 1Password

`tools/env-doctor/templates/production/notify-api.env` references the item
`AIScream/OperAI - Web Push VAPID` (field `private-key`). **That item is a placeholder and does not exist
yet.** Before enabling, either create the item in the `AIScream` vault with a `private-key` field (and keep
the public key and the subject beside it for the operator), or change the reference in the template to the
item you did create. env-doctor resolves references by name, so a wrong name is a failed check, not a
silent default.

### Variables on `notify-api` (Railway)

| Variable | Rule |
|---|---|
| `PUSH_ENABLED` | Literal `true` enables, anything else is off (same parsing as `EMAIL_ENABLED`). Default off: with it off no VAPID variable is read and nothing is sent. |
| `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY`, `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY` | Required when enabled. The service exits at startup if the private key does not derive the public key. |
| `VAPID_SUBJECT` | Required when enabled; `mailto:` or `https:`. The push services see it with every send. |
| `PUSH_EXCLUDED_ORIGINS` | Optional CSV of origin apps never pushed (for example `meetings`); values are validated, an unknown one stops the start. Default empty. |
| `APP_BASE_URL`, `AUTH_BASE_URL`, `SERVICE_CLIENT_ID`, `SERVICE_CLIENT_SECRET` | The email-notice group: **required when `PUSH_ENABLED=true`**, because a push first asks `auth` whether the recipient is still an active user (AC-5.2). Enabling push without them exits at startup. |

### Rollout order (specs/029 US-7, ADR-0086/0087)

Push makes `notify-api` ask `auth` about each recipient, so it depends on `auth`'s per-service
limits. Three steps, in this order:

1. **`auth` first.** It only widens what is admitted (20 per address becomes 300 service tokens and
   600 contact lookups per calling service per window); request and answer shapes are unchanged.
   `auth` logs `[system] limits per <ms> ms: ...` at startup: confirm the four effective values.
   Once it is live, list `auth`'s variables for the retired `SERVICE_TOKEN_RATE_*` names (the
   Step-0 command in § Notify credential rollout, Step 0) and delete any found from Railway, and
   from the local direnv / 1Password source. `mise run env:doctor -- --env production --live` then
   reports no forbidden variable.
2. **`notify-api` second** (30 s liveness memo, single-flight, bounded send pool, atomic device
   cap). It works against the old and the new `auth`; against the old one it is still bound by the
   shared 20, which is why step 3 waits.
3. **`PUSH_ENABLED=true` only after the AC-7.7 live re-measure** (specs/029 T12) passes on the
   deployed pair. This, not merge order, is the gate: Railway redeploys every service of one push
   in no fixed order, and neither order is harmful while push is off.

### Enabling in production

1. **ADR-0084 go-live sign-off first.** `docs/adr/0084-web-push-encrypted-payloads-not-fcm.md` has a
   "Go-live sign-off" line that reads *pending*. The owner records the date and the acceptance (push
   services outside the EU observe the endpoint, send time, size and VAPID contact, never the content)
   before `PUSH_ENABLED=true` is set in production. Do not enable it while that line is pending.
2. Generate the pair, store the private key, set the variables above on `notify-api`, then
   `mise run env:doctor -- --env production --dir ./resolved` (names and shape only, no values printed).
3. Deploy. `notify-api` stays a single replica (unchanged). Verify with a signed-in browser: My profile
   shows the push section, `GET /push/config` answers with the public key, and turning it on lists the
   device. With push off, `GET /push/config` answers `{ "enabled": false }` and the shell hides the section.
4. The shell serves `/push-sw.js` at the site root (the service worker must sit at the scope it controls);
   nothing extra to configure on Vercel.

### Capacity and the live re-measure

- **What push costs `auth`:** at most one contact lookup per push recipient per 30 s (the liveness
  memo; only a `found` answer is remembered, `inactive` and `failed` are asked again) plus one per
  `email: true` notice (never memoised, ADR-0056). Against `USERS_CONTACT_SERVICE_LIMIT` (600 per
  10 min) that leaves room for well over 100 notifications in 10 minutes. A user raising notifications
  at themselves in a loop is bounded at 20 lookups per 10 min.
- **Re-measure (T12, AC-7.7):** raise more than 100 notifications in 10 minutes on the dev stack, then
  on the deployed pair, and read the logs:

  ```bash
  railway logs --service auth --since 15m | grep -E 'allowance exhausted|invalid-credential limit reached' || echo "none"
  railway logs --service notify-api --since 15m | grep 'HTTP 429' || echo "none"
  ```

  Pass = `none` for both. `allowance exhausted caller=system:notify-api` means the 600 was reached
  (raise `USERS_CONTACT_SERVICE_LIMIT` or find the loop); `invalid-credential limit reached` means a
  wrong credential from one address.
- **Send pool and memo constants** (not environment variables; changing one is a code change), exported
  from `notify-api/src/channels/push.channel.ts`: `SEND_POOL_OPTIONS` = 16 concurrent sends, 1 000
  queued in total, 100 queued per recipient; `ACTIVITY_MEMO_TTL_MS` = 30 000. A full queue drops the
  push (the in-app row and SSE event stand) and logs `backlog full`.
- **A `409 device_limit` on `PUT /push/devices`** means the atomic per-user cap of 20 devices fired for
  a new endpoint; re-registering an existing endpoint is never refused. It is the cap working, not a
  database fault.

### Operating notes

- **Rotating the VAPID keys invalidates every subscription.** Each subscription was made against the old
  public key, so sends signed with the new key are not accepted for them; only 404/410 answers delete a row
  automatically, so those rows are not cleaned up on their own. After a rotation every user must turn push off and on again
  in My profile, and stale rows stay until removed there or until the user is deactivated. Rotate only
  deliberately, and announce it.
- A device the push service reports gone (404/410) is deleted on the spot; any other failure keeps the row
  and never fails the notification itself (the in-app row and the SSE event always stand).
- The browser decides whether to show: on Chrome, Edge and Firefox the service worker shows nothing while an
  Operai tab is visible (the toast covers it). **Safari always shows**, because Safari cancels a
  subscription after pushes that show nothing (ADR-0085), so a Safari user with Operai open gets both the
  toast and the system notification.
- **Apple answers 201 for subscriptions that are dead.** On `web.push.apple.com` a successful send proves
  nothing about delivery, and a cancelled Safari subscription is never reported back as 404/410; its row
  lingers until the user removes it in My profile. Do not read "no errors from Apple" as "delivered".
- Turning push off for one origin without redeploying code: set `PUSH_EXCLUDED_ORIGINS` and restart
  `notify-api`. Turning it off entirely: `PUSH_ENABLED=false`; existing rows stay and are used again when
  it is re-enabled.
- Logs carry the device id and the push status only, never an endpoint, key, title or body.

## Rollback & operations

- **Rollback:** each Railway service and each Vercel project keeps its own
  deployment history — redeploy the last good one from the dashboard. Frontends
  are independent, so rolling back one remote doesn't touch the others. If a
  Railway rollback crosses a migration boundary (older code, newer schema),
  restore Postgres from a backup or down-migrate **before** redeploying the older
  image — Railway doesn't reverse migrations.
- **Update one var later:** `railway variables --service <svc> --set "K=$K"` then
  `railway redeploy --service <svc>` (run inside the direnv shell if `K` is a
  secret). Frontend var changes need a Vercel **redeploy** (build-time).
- **EU residency (operational):** request/response bodies are never logged
  (hono/logger emits method+path+status only; Prisma `query` logging off in prod)
  across `auth`, `estimai-api`, `notify-api`, **and `refund-api`** (the last
  two handle notification title/body and financial/receipt-PII data
  respectively — the same no-body-logging rule applies to both). Don't add a
  CDN/log-aggregator/backup target that routes EU data outside the EU — this
  now also covers `refund-api`'s EU object-storage bucket once provisioned
  (ADR-0016).
- **`notify-api` single-replica constraint (specs/005 Risk R2):** never scale
  `notify-api` past one replica (Railway dashboard autoscale or a
  `.railway/railway.ts` edit) without first moving its EventBus fan-out and
  stream-ticket store onto Postgres `LISTEN`/`NOTIFY` + a shared ticket table
  — both are designed behind an interface for that migration, but the current
  in-process implementation silently breaks (missed events, ticket
  mint↔connect mismatches) across two or more instances.
- **Service-client secret rotation / revocation (specs/016, ADR-0049):** if one caller's
  secret is suspected, set a new value on its `<NAME>_SERVICE_CLIENT_SECRET` Shared
  Variable and redeploy `auth` (its `SERVICE_CLIENTS` references it) and that caller. To cut
  a caller off at once, remove its entry from `SERVICE_CLIENTS` and redeploy `auth`;
  credentials already minted expire within 5 minutes. The other callers are unaffected —
  there is no shared secret to rotate in lockstep. Never log the value; `railway variables`
  output containing it should not be pasted into chat/tickets.
- **`/system/emails` and `/system/notifications` network exposure (specs/006
  Risk R2, specs/007 ADR-0017, specs/016):** the scoped service credential is the enforced
  access control regardless of network path, but reduce exposure further by keeping
  `auth`'s and `refund-api`'s `NOTIFY_INTERNAL_URL` on notify-api's Railway
  **private**-networking hostname (never the public `<NOTIFY_API_URL>`
  domain) — these calls should never traverse the public internet.
  `notify-api` still needs its public domain for the browser-facing
  SSE/notification routes; there is currently no per-route network-level
  isolation (Railway private networking is per-service, not per-route) —
  flagged here, not solved, since splitting these internal routes onto a
  network-isolated deployment would be a new infra topology decision (ADR
  territory), not something to adopt unilaterally.
- **`refund-api` object storage not yet provisioned (T19 follow-up, human
  action required):** no EU-region bucket exists and no 1Password item exists
  for `REFUND_S3_*` — see § Variable reference's `refund-api` section, "Object
  storage — provisioning". `refund-api/src/lib/storage.ts` (T9) will consume
  these vars; local dev's placeholder values in `.env.example` are non-
  functional until a real bucket is created. This is the primary blocker for
  a genuine end-to-end T9 deploy verification (mint→confirm→signed-GET against
  a real bucket) — `bun test` itself does not require one (storage is mocked).
- **Secrets** are only ever referenced from the direnv/1Password shell, never
  pasted literally or committed; `.pem` files are gitignored; the pre-commit
  betterleaks hook guards commits.

## Users who entered without an invitation (specs/023, ADR-0071, AC-6.2)

Since specs/023 `auth` creates a user only for an email in `ALLOWED_SIGNUP_DOMAINS` that
holds a live pending invitation (or is the bootstrap admin, whose email must also be in an allowed domain); an allowed-domain email without one
joins the waiting list and an outside-domain email is refused. Users who signed in before that are left untouched
(AC-1.6); these two read-only queries list them so an admin can review by hand. Run them
against the `auth` database; neither writes anything.

**Rollout step (before the push):** on Railway, service `auth`, set
`ALLOWED_SIGNUP_DOMAINS=welld.ch,welld.it`. Without it `auth` refuses to start. After the
push `auth` migrates `access_request` on start; then run the queries below in production.

(a) Active users with no accepted invitation:

```sql
SELECT u.id, u.name, u.email, u."createdAt"
FROM "user" u
WHERE u."deletedAt" IS NULL
  AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM invitation i WHERE i."acceptedByUserId" = u.id)
ORDER BY u."createdAt";
```

(b) Active users whose email domain is outside `welld.ch` / `welld.it`:

```sql
SELECT u.id, u.name, u.email, u."createdAt"
FROM "user" u
WHERE u."deletedAt" IS NULL
  AND lower(split_part(u.email, '@', 2)) NOT IN ('welld.ch', 'welld.it')
ORDER BY u."createdAt";
```

Locally: `psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f query.sql`, or `bunx prisma db execute --stdin` from `auth/`.

## Audit-log redaction — GDPR/nLPD subject-erasure requests (specs/012-employee-address, ADR-0033, Risk R5)

As of specs/012, `auth`'s `audit_log` carries employee home addresses
(`user.address.set` entries) in its `data.before`/`data.after` payload. Per
**ADR-0033** — a deliberate, user-decided (2026-08-04) two-tier
audit-assurance model for the suite — `audit_log` is **Tier 2
(application-level immutability only)**: no mutating export from the audit
module, no mutating route on the audit API, no production code path that
updates or deletes a row. This is unlike the suite's Tier 1 tables
(`RefundAuditEntry`/`MileageRate`/`RefundSetting`, ADR-0018/0024/0027), which
carry a database-level `BEFORE UPDATE/DELETE` trigger and are permanently
unremovable by design.

That absence of a database-level guard is what makes a genuine GDPR/nLPD
**subject-erasure request technically honourable at all** for this table —
redacting the `data.before`/`data.after` payload of specific rows is
possible precisely because nothing at the database layer forbids it (a Tier 1
table would not permit this). The residual risk is **procedural, not
technical**: an ad-hoc `UPDATE`/`DELETE` leaves no record of who redacted
what, when, or why — the trail cannot record its own redaction. This runbook
exists so a real request is handled consistently, not improvised under time
pressure.

1. **Who may perform a redaction.** A person with direct production database
   access **and** explicit authorization for this specific request — e.g.
   wellD's DPO/privacy lead, or an engineer they've directed. This is
   deliberately **not** a self-service admin-panel action, because none
   exists (by design — ADR-0033 §1(c): every mutating verb on `/admin/audit`
   and `/admin/audit/{id}` returns `404`). Treat the absence of a UI for this
   as a feature, not a gap to fill.
2. **Scope the redaction to an enumerated `audit_log.id` set — never a broad
   `WHERE`.** Identify the exact rows before touching anything:
   ```sql
   SELECT id, "targetType", "targetId", action, "createdAt"
   FROM audit_log
   WHERE "targetType" = 'user' AND "targetId" = '<the subject's user id>'
     AND action = 'user.address.set';
   ```
   Record the returned `id` list — this is the set the redaction targets,
   and only this set. Never issue an `UPDATE`/`DELETE` scoped directly by
   `targetId`/`action`/a date range; always resolve to explicit `id`s first
   and redact by `id IN (...)`.
3. **Redact the payload, not the row.** Null or replace the address fields
   inside `data.before`/`data.after` (the personal data) in place — leave
   `id`, `targetType`, `targetId`, `action`, `actorUserId`, `createdAt`
   untouched, so the *fact that a change happened* stays visible and only
   the erased subject's personal-data content is removed:
   ```sql
   UPDATE audit_log
   SET data = jsonb_set(jsonb_set(data, '{before}', 'null'::jsonb, true), '{after}', 'null'::jsonb, true)
   WHERE id IN (<the enumerated id list from step 2>);
   ```
   Confirm the actual `data` shape recorded for `user.address.set` with a
   `SELECT data FROM audit_log WHERE id = <one id>` before writing the
   `UPDATE` — do not assume the JSON path above is byte-exact against the
   handler's current `withAudit` call shape.
4. **Record the act out-of-band — the trail cannot record its own
   redaction.** Before or immediately after running the `UPDATE`, open a
   ticket (or wellD's existing DPA/privacy log) recording: the requesting
   subject, the enumerated `id` list from step 2, who ran the redaction, the
   timestamp, and the legal basis (the erasure request's reference). This
   ticket **is** the audit trail for the redaction itself — `audit_log` has
   no mechanism to audit changes made to it.
5. **Do not automate this.** No cron, no scheduled job, no self-service admin
   action — consistent with this suite's standing "derived-on-read, never
   scheduled" posture for one-time operator actions (ADR-0013 lineage,
   mirrored by the accounting-distribution-email cutover script above in §
   Variable reference). Every redaction is a deliberate, individually
   authorized command run by a human against production, exactly once per
   request.

See **ADR-0033** for the full reasoning — why `audit_log` is Tier 2 rather
than Tier 1, why that is a deliberate trade-off rather than an oversight, and
the escalation path (dropping `AuditLog.actorUserId`'s FK first) if a future
regulatory or product trigger requires raising `audit_log` to Tier 1.
