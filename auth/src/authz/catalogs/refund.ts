/**
 * Refund's declared permission catalog (T2, specs/20260716-refund-service — refs
 * AC-1.1, AC-5.4, AC-7.5, AC-8.2; plan.md "Authz integration"; ADR 20260713-authz-hand-rolled-rbac-abac-epoch-claims §7).
 * Extended by T1, specs/20260720-mileage-rate (plan.md "Architecture §auth",
 * Decision 2) with a third resource, `rate` — see below.
 *
 * Mirrors `catalogs/estimai.ts`'s shape: a plain constant describing the
 * (resource, action, supportedConditions) surface `refund-api` enforces
 * server-side (ADR 20260716-refund-api-authorization-enforcing-resource-server) — NOT a database row. `../seed.ts`'s
 * `seedRefundCatalog` registers it via `upsertAppCatalog` (one full-replace
 * upsert keyed by `appId`), so the admin-ui rule composer can build roles
 * against it and `refund-api`'s `authzMiddleware` (T6) can gate real routes
 * against the SAME declared (resource, action) pairs.
 *
 * Extended by T1, specs/20260721-self-approval-control (plan.md Decision D1;
 * ADR 20260721-self-approval-condition-and-403-exception): `request.approve` gains a SECOND supported condition,
 * `self-approval` — a segregation-of-duties deny-carve-out
 * (`{key:"self-approval", match:"deny"}`, opposite polarity from `entity`'s
 * `match:"user"`), declared on `approve` ONLY (D3/AC-4.3) — never on
 * `reject`/`set-approved-total`/`review`/`read`/`create`. This is the ONLY
 * code change specs/20260721-self-approval-control makes in `auth`: the attribute rides the existing
 * free-form `attributes[]` machinery (resolver `toRuleConditions`, the wire
 * schemas, and `findRuleViolations`'s catalog gate) unchanged.
 *
 * Extended by T1, specs/20260722-refund-settings (plan.md "Architecture §auth",
 * Decision D2; ADR 20260722-settings-catalog-permission-config-not-rate) with a FOURTH resource, `settings` — see below.
 *
 * `refund` was previously an access-only stub registered by
 * `seedAppAccessCatalog`'s `SUITE_APPS` list (spec 004). This is refund's
 * FULL catalog — `refund` moves OUT of `SUITE_APPS` (exactly as `estimai`
 * was excluded there) so its `access` action is registered exactly once,
 * here, alongside its own domain resources, not via two potentially-
 * conflicting full-replace upserts.
 *
 * Four resources:
 *   - `refund` (the app-access resource, keyed by the app id itself) — a
 *     single `access` action, no conditions. Same shape every suite app's
 *     access resource gets.
 *   - `request` — the domain resource — with the six actions plan.md's
 *     "Authz integration" section enumerates. `supportedConditions` per
 *     action, exactly as specified there:
 *       - `create`             — `[]` (an employee owns whatever they create;
 *                                  no condition needed to gate creation itself)
 *       - `read`                — `["ownership"]` (an employee reads their
 *                                  own requests; `ownership:own`)
 *       - `review`              — `["entity"]` (accounting: queue + full
 *                                  detail, entity-scoped per ADR 20260716-entity-scoped-abac-refund-api)
 *       - `set-approved-total`  — `["entity"]`
 *       - `approve`             — `["entity", "self-approval"]` (specs/20260721-self-approval-control,
 *                                  ADR 20260721-self-approval-condition-and-403-exception — the self-approval SoD condition
 *                                  is declared here ONLY)
 *       - `reject`              — `["entity"]`
 *     Submit/withdraw/edit/delete of a draft are authorized by `create` +
 *     ownership of the request (the creator) per plan.md — they are
 *     deliberately NOT separate catalog actions.
 *   - `rate` (T1, specs/20260720-mileage-rate) — the mileage-rate configuration
 *     resource, with `read`/`manage` actions. BOTH deliberately declare NO
 *     `supportedConditions` — a stark contrast with `request`'s entity-scoped
 *     accounting actions (ADR 20260716-entity-scoped-abac-refund-api): rate configuration is suite-wide, not
 *     per-entity, so there is no attribute to condition on (plan.md
 *     "Architecture §auth", Decision 2). Rate storage/logic itself lives
 *     entirely in `refund-api` — this catalog only declares the permission
 *     surface; `auth` never gains a rate data table or API.
 *   - `settings` (T1, specs/20260722-refund-settings; ADR 20260722-settings-catalog-permission-config-not-rate) — the refund
 *     config resource (currently one setting: the accounting distribution
 *     email), with `read`/`manage` actions. Both deliberately declare NO
 *     `supportedConditions` — global/unconditioned, the same shape as `rate`
 *     (plan.md "Architecture §auth", Decision D2) — but this is a DISTINCT
 *     resource from `rate`, not a third action on it: a distribution mailbox
 *     is not a rate, and conflating the two would make the two admin
 *     surfaces un-separable/un-auditable in isolation (ADR 20260722-settings-catalog-permission-config-not-rate). Unlike
 *     `rate:read` (deliberately ungated for `GET /rates/effective`'s
 *     employee-facing read, ADR 20260720-mileage-rate-model-snapshot-admin-ui-composition), `settings:read` IS a real
 *     authorization boundary — a non-holder must not even learn the mailbox
 *     exists (AC-3.2). Settings storage/logic itself lives entirely in
 *     `refund-api` (the `refund_setting` table, ADR 20260722-refund-settings-append-only-self-auditing-store) — this catalog
 *     only declares the permission surface; `auth` never gains a settings
 *     data table or API.
 *
 * Declaration only: registering this catalog does NOT itself grant anything
 * — `seedRefundCatalog` (catalog) and the SEPARATE `accounting`/`admin`/
 * `refund-admin` role grants (`seed.ts`'s `seedAccountingRoleGrants`/
 * `seedAdminRoleGrants`/`seedRefundAdminRole`/`seedRateAdminGrants`/
 * `seedSettingsAdminGrants`) are independent steps, exactly as
 * `seedEstimaiCatalog`/`seedAdminRoleGrants` are for EstimAI/admin.
