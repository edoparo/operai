/**
 * Parsing and validation of the `SERVICE_CLIENTS` env value (T4, specs/015-
 * hardware-inventory — ADR-0044): the per-client entries that
 * `POST /system/service-token` authenticates against.
 *
 * Kept free of any import from `../lib/env` (which imports THIS file to
 * validate the variable at startup) so there is no cycle, and free of any
 * secret-bearing output: a parse failure names the client id and the rule that
 * failed, never a secret value or a slice of the raw JSON.
 *
 * Format — a JSON object keyed by client id:
 *
 *   {"inventory-api":{"secret":"<random, >= 32 chars>","scope":"notifications.push"}}
 *
 * - client id: lower-case alphanumerics and single hyphens, <= 64 chars. It
 *   becomes the token's `sub` as `system:<clientId>`, so it must be impossible
 *   to confuse with a user id.
 * - secret: >= 32 chars (mirrors `inventory-api`'s own `SERVICE_CLIENT_SECRET`
 *   minimum) and <= 256.
 * - client id `auth` is reserved (specs/016): `auth` mints its own credential
 *   in process as `system:auth`, so no configured client may claim that `sub`.
 * - scope: space-delimited, each entry from {@link KNOWN_SERVICE_SCOPES}. A
 *   typo or an invented scope refuses to start rather than minting a token
 *   whose scope no resource server understands (or, worse, one it widens).
 *
 * Revoking a client is removing its entry; tokens already minted expire within
 * {@link SERVICE_TOKEN_TTL_SECONDS}.

 *   `POST /system/users/contact` (specs/019, D-1). Only notify-api holds it.
 * - `estimate-notices.send`: tell crm-api an EstimAI estimate was closed or
 *   reopened (`POST /system/estimate-notices`, specs/018 AC-3.3, ADR-0073).
 *   Only estimai-api holds it.
 * - `host-notices.send`: post a meeting's link/change/delete notice to a host
 *   app's `/system/meeting-host/v1/notices` (specs/021, AC-11.8). crm-api
 *   verifies it; the sub allowlist there names `system:meetings-api`.
 * - `deal-link-notices.send`: post a deal-link notice (linked/unlinked) to
 *   estimai-api's `/system/deal-link-notices` (specs/024, ADR-0076).
 *   estimai-api verifies it; its sub allowlist names `system:crm-api`.
 * - `crm.companies.read`: read CRM companies through crm-api's
 *   `GET /system/companies` (specs/025, ADR-0080). Only projects-api holds it.
 * - `activities.write`: write to activities-api's `/system/v1/*` routes — the
 *   estimate-request task, completion, meeting-host state and contact erasure
 *   (specs/028, ADR-0081/0082). Only crm-api holds it; activities-api's sub
 *   allowlist names `system:crm-api`.
 * - `crm.deals.read`: read won deals through crm-api's `GET /system/deals` (specs/026).
 *   Only projects-api holds it.
 * - `estimai.estimates.read`: read an estimate's man-days through estimai-api's
 *   `GET /system/estimates/{id}/summary` (specs/026). Only projects-api holds it.
 * - `crm.contacts.read`: read a company's contacts, or contacts by id (the referent of a
 *   purchase order), through crm-api's `GET /system/contacts` (specs/026, D49). Only
 *   projects-api holds it.
 * - `projects.purchase-orders.read`: read the purchase orders of given deals through
 *   projects-api's `GET /system/purchase-orders` (specs/026; was `projects.contracts.read`,
 *   retired with "contract", D38). Only crm-api holds it.
 * - `meetings.hosts.read`: read which host record (today a CRM deal) each meeting is linked to,
 *   through meetings-api's `GET /system/meetings/hosts` (specs/029, ADR-0089). Only hours-api
 *   holds it; meetings-api's sub allowlist names `system:hours-api`. It answers `{id, host}` and
 *   nothing else — no title, participant or duration.
